11,2210,2,Giving benefit of doubt here. Only some spend analytics services are cited here - which is about 10% of the breadth of services that is in scope for this question.
11,2211,0,Same as above
11,2212,1.5,Same as above
11,2213,0,"Only higher because our description depicts a very spend-centric scope rather than broader MDM, item, contracts, supplier, process mining, big data ingestion (e.g., commodity prices)"

11,2217,4,"Having vertical SIGs is great to share qualitative learnings, but formalized performance/capability measurement and gap closure is critical to fact based target setting, value measurement, etc. If GEP can demonstrate some quantitative fact-based analytic-driven diagnostics... SEE MORE IN EXCEL RFI"
11,2218,3,Definitely differentiated against S2P tech providers and can compete against traditional consultants. Would like to see how digital diagnostics and SMI are integrated into the transformation - to get to a five.
11,2219,3,Congrats. Worthy of the 5 here!
11,2220,3,Good solid 3 on this. Most major providers do this.
11,2221,3.5,"Great passion here, but we're looking for actual examples of service innovation. E.g., on-demand productized CoEs for SMI, sourcing events, digital transformation (e.g., agile development). We'll give benefit of doubt with a '3'"

11,2228,4.5,Terrific. When you tell us what types of SMI are delivered - and how - we can give a llittle more credit. A one sentence marketing blurb is not going to do it.

12,539,2,"again, no specific functionality ... I hope the upgrades to performance scheduled for end of year address this"
12,540,2,only because the form capability allows for solicited input of an unpsecified nature ... but this is a kluge and not a long-term approach

12,585,2,"same as before - refers to multi-tier supplier information beyond tier 1, not matrix segmentation of tier 1"
12,586,4,we're looking for configuration around collaboration and inovation as well ... but we'll definitely give a 4 here
12,587,5,"4, and easy to see how a segment of customers would buy based on this"
12,588,5,"4 with local support across invoices and taxation and local compliance, 5 because certan multinationals will buy because of SAP's Global Prsence"
