GEP operates a dedicated supplier enablement team who support both buyers and suppliers through the initial on-boarding phase and through subsequent operational phases.
SMART by GEP provides a hierarchical and trigger-enabled form system that can require additional information from suppliers based upon the responses provided to early registration questions or to changes in supplier status or profile date.
SMART by GEP is integrated with TinCheck.com and Global Risk Management Solutions to augment the supplier profile with identity and risk verification data.
Typical deployments of SMART by GEP involve large numbers of suppliers and onboarding phasing is largely determined by invoice volumes and spend.  Our supplier enablement teams work with customers to determine the breakdown of suppliers into groupings through high volume/high spend/strategically important to non-core.  Typically the highest priority group accounts for over 80% of annual volume and spend but represents a low number of suppliers and focus is brought to that group in the first instance.
Registration for suppliers is rapid, taking as little as few minutes for a supplier to self-register on SMART by GEP.  Refinement of supplier records, mandatory documents and certificates, EDI integration and other steps can take time but the basic onboarding process is rapid.
There are no fees associated with SMART by GEP for suppliers whatsoever.
Training for suppliers is conducted by the supplier enablement team and, according to the specific configuration of SMART by GEP in question training can be extensive to include participation in sourcing events, RFx and Auctions, collaboration on contracts, catalog management, profile and record management, order processing and invoice creation and more.

The accuracy that resulta dependa upon the industry and category past models. Initial accuracy can be around 65%. With iterative training cycls and client-specific models, the accuracy rapidly accelerates. Further improvement is achieved over time with each periodic refresh as the models become more accurate. The size of each training set depends on the category hetergoeneity and not merely on the number of transaction lines. Client feedback engagement provides an easy and successful means of error-correction . Client feedback goes through approval process with included conflict checks. 
The enrichment process has the following steps:
1. Base model run
• GEP will run Customer’ one year historical data across the base learning our tool has aggregated from our previous 150+ global deployments.
• The classification engine assigns a confidence level for every transaction it process, which is used as a guideline for quality checks.
• Our experience has been that these base model runs provide us accuracies in range of 65% - 80%

2. Quality check by GEP category experts
• GEP category experts review the output of the automated engine, to identify areas (data patterns, suppliers, categories etc.) where the engine is processing transactions incorrectly.
• These experts correct these transactions and then feed them back to the engine for additional learning.
• Steps 1 & 2 are iterative until the accuracy levels reach 90%+ range

3. Perception alignment with Customer category experts
GEP will then interview Customer’ category experts on cases which need additional clarifications. 
Our experience across 150+ deployments of spend analysis indicates 
• This is a critical process to enrich data based on end user needs and goes a long way in user adoption
• We typically need 4 – 6 category experts from Customer for approx... 2 – 3 hours to gather their inputs

4. Final QA and testing

• Refine the learning of the engine using the inputs gathered from Customer users. 
• Do final QA checks and deploy a enrichment model which is unique based on Customer’ data and provides a minimum 90% spend accuracy

For SMART by GEP Spend analytics and reporting functions, we recommend data transfer over secured FTP connection. We have generally seen there is no real need for an extensive intrusive interface with the client’s systems.

Physical connections with client systems can be performed in the flat file mode. This is typical method deployed for spend implementations. It is simple to design, configure and deploy. It does not involve much interaction from the client's IT team.

The raw / cleansed / summarized data can be transferred  through flat file formats like xls,csv etc. over a secure FTP site.
