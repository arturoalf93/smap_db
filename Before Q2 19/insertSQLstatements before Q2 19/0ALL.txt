GEP operates a dedicated supplier enablement team who support both buyers and suppliers through the initial on-boarding phase and through subsequent operational phases.
SMART by GEP provides a hierarchical and trigger-enabled form system that can require additional information from suppliers based upon the responses provided to early registration questions or to changes in supplier status or profile date.
SMART by GEP is integrated with TinCheck.com and Global Risk Management Solutions to augment the supplier profile with identity and risk verification data.
Typical deployments of SMART by GEP involve large numbers of suppliers and onboarding phasing is largely determined by invoice volumes and spend.  Our supplier enablement teams work with customers to determine the breakdown of suppliers into groupings through high volume/high spend/strategically important to non-core.  Typically the highest priority group accounts for over 80% of annual volume and spend but represents a low number of suppliers and focus is brought to that group in the first instance.
Registration for suppliers is rapid, taking as little as few minutes for a supplier to self-register on SMART by GEP.  Refinement of supplier records, mandatory documents and certificates, EDI integration and other steps can take time but the basic onboarding process is rapid.
There are no fees associated with SMART by GEP for suppliers whatsoever.
Training for suppliers is conducted by the supplier enablement team and, according to the specific configuration of SMART by GEP in question training can be extensive to include participation in sourcing events, RFx and Auctions, collaboration on contracts, catalog management, profile and record management, order processing and invoice creation and more.

Client feedback engagement provides an easy and successful means of error-correction . Client feedback goes through approval process with included conflict checks. 
The enrichment process has the following steps:
1. Base model run
• GEP will run Customer’ one year historical data across the base learning our tool has aggregated from our previous 150+ global deployments.
• The classification engine assigns a confidence level for every transaction it process, which is used as a guideline for quality checks.
• Our experience has been that these base model runs provide us accuracies in range of 65% - 80%

2. Quality check by GEP category experts
• GEP category experts review the output of the automated engine, to identify areas (data patterns, suppliers, categories etc.) where the engine is processing transactions incorrectly.
• These experts correct these transactions and then feed them back to the engine for additional learning.
• Steps 1 & 2 are iterative until the accuracy levels reach 90%+ range

3. Perception alignment with Customer category experts

SMART by GEP is built completely on the Microsoft Azure cloud affording a degree of security, scale and support that is simply unavailable in a private or hosted SaaS model.
From database balancing to uptime, from dynamic scalability to data security there is no other platform that can outcompete Azure and thus these capabilities are inherited by the SMART by GEP application layer.
