If this talent pool does not deliver the exact match, say - it's the same type of talent always required but this is a one-off requirement in Portugal, then the larger network comes into play - the requirement is offered to the wider matches.

Beeline VMS provides smart and intuitive simple search capabilities. The Simple Search gives users a tool to find information easier and quicker throughout the system. Searches can be performed by entering a few characters of the information they are looking for and through smart logic it will return matches relating to assignments, requests, candidates, projects, suppliers, etc. with minimal effort.
Beeline Self-Sourcing includes a proprietary matching algorithm that will highlight how well the talent matches the position. This algorithm considers and weights variables such as skills and keywords matching, preferred rate versus expected rate card, availability, activity and responsiveness, location, and performance feedback. Key elements of the matching algorithm, such as key words, are also highlighted to provide visual reference of matched criteria.Our solutions primarily use cognitive and analytical technologies for conversational user experiences as well as information storage and retrieval. More specifically, we use IBM Watson’s Natural Language Understanding, Natural Language Classifier, Conversation (now Assistant), Microsoft’s BotFramework, and in-house NLP (Machine Learning) modules. Some examples of Beeline solutions powered by these cognitive analytical technologies today include:
 
 • Beeline’s Automated Talent Ontology Machine (ATOM), leverages aggregated anonymized data, third-party data sources and services, and Applied AI (Artificial Intelligence) to deliver market data for rates and time-to-fill metrics and predictions. 
 • Beeline’s bot, called Beeline Assistant is available for users today through conversational tools like Skype. The first skill users can access through Beeline Assistant is retrieving insights about market rate data and time-to-fill benchmarks. Because Beeline Assistant uses IBM Watson for natural language processing, user interaction is simple and conversational. Soon, Beeline users will be able to use the Beeline Assistant bot to automate tasks in the VMS previously performed by users (such as extending assignments). 
 • Beeline’s One Click Request functionality identifies users’ hiring patterns to provide a highly efficient and intelligent experience for managers, which encourages greater adoption. 
 
 In our R&D/Innovation Lab, we have also used Amazon Lex, IBM Watson Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, Personality Insights and IBM Watson Discovery (Studio), amongst other cognitive (AI) technologies and data classification services to enrich our data intelligence and user experience efforts.

These decisions could range from what type of labor is needed to creating a specific report tailored to their needs. For example, by answering a series of client-defined questions, Guide Me assists users in identifying if they are looking for a traditional staffing engagement or a more complex consulting engagement, and then routes them directly to the appropriate procurement workflow.  With Guide Me, a client’s hiring managers can be guided to follow any number of the client’s policies/procedures at key decision making steps throughout the procurement and contract labor management process.  Guide Me is fully reportable and can be utilized as an entry point into Beeline through a secured link on the client’s intranet portal, accessed via single sign on.

Supplier Scorecard
Supplier performance is a key component to the success of the program. Beeline provides an enhanced, robust supplier scorecard to continuously measure the supplier community. Beeline provides this interactive supplier scorecard within Beeline VMS.

Beeline’s Supplier Scorecard utilizes fact-based metrics from your Beeline data to allow you to objectively evaluate the value you receive from your suppliers. Flexible scoring allows you to do side-by-side comparisons and overall rank across all your suppliers, based on the competencies you define. So you can track performance over time and measure progress around your company’s strategic goals. The Beeline Supplier Scorecard provides very high-level scoring in an intuitive, easy-to-understand format, but also allows a user to dive deep into in-depth analysis depending on the level of detail needed. The metrics leveraged in the scorecard are broken into three main categories that our clients value most in a supplier: quality, cost, and efficiency. Criteria for metrics in these categories are listed below.  

Quality Metrics

• Placements Count – The number of placements for each supplier.
• Supplier Response Ratio – The ratio of received requests (with at least one submitted candidate) to the total number of received requests.
• Submit to Hire Ratio – The supplier's overall submit to hire ratio across all requisitions that had at least one candidate hired in the particular quarter.
• Submit to Interview Ratio – The supplier's overall submit to interview ratio across all requisitions that had at least one candidate interviewed in the particular quarter.
• Interview To Hire Ratio – The supplier's interview to hire ratio across all requisitions that had at least one candidate hired in the particular quarter.
• Placements Count – The count of placements in a particular quarter for each supplier.
• Average Candidate Interview Rating – The average interview rating of supplier's candidates that were submitted in a particular quarter.
• Offer Rejection Count – The count of suppliers who had a candidate that rejected an offer at some point in the procurement workflow life cycle.
• Offer Rejection Ratio – The ratio of suppliers who had a candidate that rejected an offer at some point in the procurement workflow life cycle.
• Unfavorable Termination Ratio – Ratio of unfavorable terminations to all terminations.

Efficiency Metrics

• First Candidate Response Time – The time in calendar days between the supplier’s received date and their first submitted candidate response date. This report is also available in business days.
• Interview Response Time – The average time in days from when an interview is requested to when it is scheduled. This report is also available in business days.
• Offer Response Time – The average time in days from when an offer is made to when it is accepted. This report is also available in business days.

Cost Metrics

• Supplier Markup Ratio – The average percent of markup from the pay rate (supplier to contractor) to the bill rate (client to supplier) for assignments that started in a particular quarter.
• Submit to Request Rate Variance – The percent deviation of the offer accepted rate from the client requested rate for each supplier in a particular quarter.
• Placements Over Rate Card Count – The count of placements submitted that were over the rate card for each supplier in a particular quarter. 
• Submit Rate To Request Rate Ratio – The percent difference of the submitted rate to the requested rate.
• Placements Not Over the Rate Card Count – The count of placements submitted that were under or equal to the rate card for each supplier in a particular quarter.

The number of attachments is unlimited.

Attachments are encrypted while stored in the application, however individual attachments are not encrypted in addition to disk encryption. Only authorized users in the application are allowed to see attachments, and even if it were encrypted by the application, an authorized user who requested the document would receive it in an unencrypted format.

Our candidate management tool also includes an Enhanced Resume View where candidate resumes are easy to preview quickly by selecting the resume icon which highlights the job title, recent experience, and any skills matched from the request. It also allows a user to shuffle through multiple resumes without having to close the previous one, allowing the manager to be more efficient with their time getting their positions filled more quickly which can be a significant cost savings.",3,

Beeline,1067,2018,3,1,3,"The Beeline application and database uses security rules such as data validation and encapsulation. These rules are tested using internal tools, as well as fuzzing techniques through application code scans, which check for the ability to circumvent those rules.

For feeds and interfaces, Beeline uses SFTP to import/export data, IP whitelists between SFTP servers, and PGP file level encryption, depending on each client’s unique security requirements. Beeline employs extensive data validation in the application at multiple tiers to ensure data integrity and detect data corruption. To facilitate data validation and integrity, Beeline will:

• Apply data validations and business logic to all incoming data during the integration process
• Do multi-layer data validation to ensure all input conforms to previously defined validation logic
• Use business logic in the code to ensure type matching and correctness
• Ensure that there are no buffer overruns
• Use native datatypes (numbers, dates, timestamps, etc.) in the database to ensure valid data elements.
• Enable referential integrity within the database for primary keys and foreign keys to ensure that there are no orphaned or inconsistent data ever in the database
• Ensure data is encrypted when data is moving across public networks

Beeline performs input validation for types such as string and integers. In addition, we perform HTML sanitization and cross-site scripting detection and prevention.  Additional validations include not allowing the use of scripting languages such as JavaScript and the use of vetted white-lists for file transfers. In all cases, any user input is checked for malicious content or potential encoding issues.

Data Integrity is covered in Beeline’s Privacy and Protection of Personal Information A18.1.4 policy.",3,
Beeline,1068,2018,3,1,3,"Beeline implements a tiered application architecture. Through this architecture, our application is highly scalable to large deployments. The architecture is defined as follows:

• Client Component: Beeline implements a thin client side of the application consisting of the browser, ASP .NET pages, and Java Script.
• Middle Tier / Business Logic Component: Beeline utilizes C# server components to implement its middle or business logic tier.
• Data Access Tier: Beeline's data access tier consists of a loosely coupled, highly optimized persistence engine, which uses .NET ADO to connect with the Microsoft SQL Server platform (MS SQL Server 2016).
• Each Beeline client web instance is logically segregated, has its own application pool, and is secured with separate domain credentials. In the case of programmatic controls (multi-tenant approach), the onus is on the software developers to ensure that the program code properly applies the filtering logic required to prevent user access to other companies’ data.

All network connections to the Beeline applications terminate on our load balancers in the Beeline DMZ and require HTTPS. All connections to Beeline system interfaces are configured with security capabilities that ensure clients' systems are the source and destination for data exchanges. 

As part of an ongoing effort, Beeline is transitioning our technology platform to Microservices, a variant of the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) style. Beeline’s adoption of a Microservices-based architecture for future development of new features and services does not require additional client work or disruption to our clients. Microservices is the leading way companies such as Google and Amazon develop their technologies. The advantages of this new architecture far outweigh the monolithic SOA based architecture our competitors use. Using this architecture, Beeline is able to develop industry leading products and functionality faster without being tied to a single technology stack or programming language. There are many additional benefits for our clients including optimized hardware therefore increasing performance, zero downtime for deployments, system resilience and other great benefits. Further information on the benefits of Microservices, can be found through this link:

Beeline's external boundary is protected by Cloudflare, providing Content Delivery Network services which ensures high availability, performance and security. Edge routers are armed with access control lists; egress/ingress filters that act as a first line of defense while a redundant set of firewalls provide the second tier of network security protection. All applications servicing external users reside within the DMZ segment, which provides an extra layer of defense between external and internal networks. Only ports deemed necessary are opened for external access, while others are specifically defined with access control lists.

Each user is created within the context of an organization and that user can only view data that belongs to that organization.

When Beeline VMS is implemented, there are roles that clients typically implement in the VMS. These roles can be modified to meet each client's business needs and additional roles can be added. The roles define the visibility and permissions allowed to that role. For example, a hiring manager role may not have visibility to supplier data; however, the role permissions allow the hiring manager to amend assignments. Furthermore, visibility can be determined based on organizational hierarchy.

The cost of customization is based on items such as whether the cost is shared amongst several clients, and the complexity of the issue. Costs will be reviewed with the client during the process.

Change Requests include requests for a new feed or integration, or a change to an existing one. When requirements are defined and feasibility determined, a proposal will be presented to the client and once approved, the integration or feed is developed. These are also managed by a Client Operations Manager.

The priority level of a Change Request is determined during the review process based on the level of development needed, the staff resources that will need to be assigned, and the business impact of the requested change.

Beeline,1100,2018,3,1,4,"The Beeline Community is an online community for Beeline clients, partners, and colleagues to communicate with one another as well as gain access to key information and tools. Through the Beeline Community, clients and partners are able to: connect directly with the Advisory Council – their peer advocates; participate in technology focus groups, conversations, and polls; and discuss and vote on product enhancement ideas.

Beeline’s IdeaStudio is a key part of the Beeline Community. IdeaStudio is a platform for crowdsourcing business challenges that can help influence Beeline’s product roadmap. Clients and partners can post their business problems and product feedback in IdeaStudio then vote on the ideas and obstacles they relate to the most. As business problems gain votes, they move up in popularity. Each quarter, Beeline’s Product Management team reviews these problems for potential inclusion in our product roadmaps. Ideas from IdeaStudio initiate about 30% of our product development. 

— Ideas that gain community attraction become viable candidates for product development.
— Beeline’s product management team reviews each idea to evaluate its market relevance. 
— If an idea does not gain community traction, it does not mean it isn’t important. While we prefer to build our solutions for the broadest possible audience, we recognize that sometimes there are special situations unique to a particular organization. A process should never be so rigid that it cannot adapt to meet the business need.
— Unlike other VMS solutions, our online community is truly an integral part of our process and directly influences our product development.

Beeline,1111,2018,3,1,4,"Beeline has been working with clients and their associated global programs since the launch of Beeline VMS in 2000. During the Initiate phase of Implementation, Beeline will review a client's processes to determine the specific configuration adjustments needed for managing their international extended workforce. 

Beeline’s global expansion plans leverage what we know based on current clients and their plans, as well as on countries we are targeting as a result of feedback and market information gleaned by our in-region teams. We know the market is ever-changing; having experienced teams in-region ensures we keep Beeline VMS configured to meet the regional/local regulations so clients can feel confident they are following the latest in-country/region requirements. The in-region teams are aware of changes (political, financial, corporate, etc.) that may affect not only the Beeline plans, but also our clients, and alert the Beeline teams so action can be taken, when required.

Beeline VMS includes functionality for ""country and region"" options; clients can associate data, business rules, and workflow rules to geography (single country or group of countries) simply through configuration. This provides clients the opportunity to configure the application to the workflow and requirements of not only departments, but also individuals in different regions or geographies. Individual users can have Beeline VMS reflect both the cultural settings of their choice. This allows Beeline to provide a flexible solution for clients to implement one instance across many countries. Configuration adjustments also support filtering and validating data, restricting what some users can do, and running financial reports by country, region, and/or labor category.

Some of the features implemented in real life situations in different countries include, but are not limited to:  

• Ability to calculate VAT/GST tax according to relevant local laws (for example: Beeline VMS applies VAT is applied at invoice level instead of line item, as U.S. sales tax is calculated; different VAT rates and exemptions are accommodated by the application).
• Ability to calculate pay to bill rate through coefficient (different coefficients per suppliers per earning codes).
• Ability to handle non-hours related earning codes such as travel allowances and lunch vouchers with their corresponding coefficient or markup and impact on the invoice.
• Ability to interpret timesheet information using entered worked hours to create a pre-invoice applying complex business logic to cope with collective labor agreement requirements, ensuring data entry is reduced for users and minimizing the risk of manual errors impacting the invoice.
• Ability to use Beeline VMS as a single source of information for the invoicing process as well as provide suppliers with the ability to process their payrolling activities.
• Ability to provide suppliers the relevant timesheet information in compliance with the legal date constraints for payrolling workers (i.e., end-of-month management).
• Ability to produce tax-compliant local invoices based on application data with a look and feel familiar to clients, suppliers, and tax authorities.
• Ability to generate individual, contractual documents for each assignment in compliance with the legal requirements in many countries.
• Ability to incorporate (localize) varying terminology and process flows to manage temporary staffing and consulting.
• Ability to implement phasing system for temporary workers where applicable.
• Ability to manage equal pay enforcement, including relevant clocking system to count weeks according to the law, versus a basic tenure report.
• Ability to incorporate and ensure involvement of trade unions or works councils into the approbation workflow for temporary staffing positions where required.
• Ability to handle National Insurance (NI) and Working Time Directive (WTD) social costs for the UK that are a percentage of the Pay Rate. These costs are then applied to the Pay Rate to make up the Bill Rate. An example of that calculation would be Pay Rate + NI + WTD + Markup = Bill Rate.
• Ability to fully meet requirements of the Agency Worker Regulations including among other things, a clocking system tracking the concept of weeks as defined by the law (quite different form a simple tenure report). 
• Ability to store candidate name in both English and local language which is common in Japan and China.",3,

Beeline,1115,2018,3,1,2,"Requests in Beeline show in a single currency.  In our experience clients budget for positions in a single currency (usually either a single global currency or based on the currency the project will be billed in).  Requests are used to capture estimated cost which is then used to compare to budget and drive approval.  For this reason requests are tied to a single currency.  

However once a budget has been established, fulfillment can happen in any other currency.  In other words position requests or SOWs can be fulfilled in any currency or multiple currencies and the currency is converted against the budget currency.  For example a position can be budgeted in British pounds but the hired assignment can be in Indian Rupees. ",2,

Beeline,667,2018,3,1,3,"The Beeline Vendor Compliance Department oversees the vetting and compliance of all Beeline client suppliers. This department manages the Vendor Compliance System, through which all supplier administration and compliance monitoring occurs.
All suppliers identified by our clients are required to agree to terms and conditions using Beeline’s click through agreement feature before gaining access to Beeline VMS. Upon first login, the supplier users will be presented with Terms and Agreement from the Beeline/supplier contract. Once accepted, they will be logged in and can use Beeline. If the supplier does not agree, they will not be allowed to login to Beeline.

Beeline,669,2018,3,1,4,"Beeline VMS accommodates the selection and management of preferred (and non-preferred if the client requires) suppliers through the use of automated tier administration and request release. Once the strategy is set and configured in Beeline VMS, buyers are not required to be involved. With tier administration, suppliers can be grouped according to specified tier levels allowing for release to specific suppliers within accepted timelines or when specified conditions exist. Supplier selection rules can be based on skill set, region, work location, currency, request type, job class, or minority code. Suppliers can exist in multiple tiers, as needed. A time delay can be set to automatically release requisitions accordingly. 

Rotations can also be set to change tier releasing to every “x” number of requisitions. Suppliers can also be pre-selected for specific skill sets, location, labor category, etc. This allows for the auto-selection of suppliers by desired requirements to ensure that the right suppliers respond. 

A tiered supplier list can be leveraged for initial release of requisitions to your prime suppliers that have the most cost effective rate cards ensuring that the client can optimize costs for extended workforce. This also ensures that your strategic suppliers can increase their revenue by being first to receive requisitions and mutually enhancing your strategic relationship.",4,
Beeline,670,2018,3,1,4,"Beeline supports the use of rotations. Requisitions can go through different supplier groupings based on the client's configurations. 

This grouping of vendors based on predefined rules (geography, skills niche, rate card, etc.) provides the client with the assurance the requests are receiving attention from suppliers who can and are most interested in providing the resources. 

In addition, when suppliers receive requests they can distribute the requisitions as appropriate based on their own business criteria.  Often suppliers work with multiple branches in their network to handle specific requests. The distribution of requests often take place outside of the VMS and are done based on the job type, skills, or location required by the client. Beeline VMS makes the process easier to manage by providing suppliers with the ability to set up their own distribution lists for their branches based on their criteria, all managed within the VMS.
",4,
Beeline,671,2018,3,1,4,"The Supplier Profile Screen in Beeline VMS provides quick and efficient access to a summary profile of each supplier in your program. The display screen is divided into quadrants, each with a different informational focus. The standard format includes the following sections:

• Information: This quadrant contains basic information about the supplier including diversity status and all associated industries.
• Financial: This quadrant displays the financial trend for the supplier in chart format with drill down functionality to additional details.
• Activity: This quadrant contains a set of tabbed reports showing activity data such as active contractors, pending interviews, open requests, and top five jobs.
• Supplier Administration: This quadrant allows for the tracking of vendor compliance and for easy editing of a supplier's information including their industry associations.

Visibility to the Supplier Profiles can be assigned by user role. Access is via the Simple Search selection options from the header menu bar. Supplier Profile Screens give users a quick and efficient way to review all the pertinent information and activity for a supplier in one centralized place. Profile screens can be personalized for each program's specific needs. 

Beeline tracks most key information (e.g. contact details, address, etc.) about the supplier in our VMS. Additionally, we also leverage our Vendor Compliance System to track supplier verification. We typically do not delete supplier records due to reporting but are able to control whether they are engaged in New Requests or Projects, or are active.",4,
Beeline,672,2018,3,1,4,"Supplier quality and performance is a key component to the success of the program. Beeline provides an enhanced, robust supplier scorecard to continuously measure the supplier community. Beeline provides this interactive supplier scorecard within Beeline VMS.

Beeline’s Supplier Scorecard utilizes fact-based metrics from your Beeline data to allow you to objectively evaluate the value you receive from your suppliers. Flexible scoring allows you to do side-by-side comparisons and overall rank across all your suppliers, based on the competencies you define. So you can track performance over time and measure progress around your company’s strategic goals. The Beeline Supplier Scorecard provides very high-level scoring in an intuitive, easy-to-understand format, but also allows a user to dive deep into in-depth analysis depending on the level of detail needed. The metrics leveraged in the scorecard are broken into three main categories that our clients value most in a supplier: quality, cost, and efficiency. Criteria for metrics in these categories are listed below.  

Quality Metrics

• Placements Count – The number of placements for each supplier.
• Supplier Response Ratio – The ratio of received requests (with at least one submitted candidate) to the total number of received requests.
• Submit to Hire Ratio – The supplier's overall submit to hire ratio across all requisitions that had at least one candidate hired in the particular quarter.
• Submit to Interview Ratio – The supplier's overall submit to interview ratio across all requisitions that had at least one candidate interviewed in the particular quarter.
• Interview To Hire Ratio – The supplier's interview to hire ratio across all requisitions that had at least one candidate hired in the particular quarter.
• Placements Count – The count of placements in a particular quarter for each supplier.
• Average Candidate Interview Rating – The average interview rating of supplier's candidates that were submitted in a particular quarter.
• Offer Rejection Count – The count of suppliers who had a candidate that rejected an offer at some point in the procurement workflow life cycle.
• Offer Rejection Ratio – The ratio of suppliers who had a candidate that rejected an offer at some point in the procurement workflow life cycle.
• Unfavorable Termination Ratio – Ratio of unfavorable terminations to all terminations.

Efficiency Metrics

• First Candidate Response Time – The time in calendar days between the supplier’s received date and their first submitted candidate response date. This report is also available in business days.
• Interview Response Time – The average time in days from when an interview is requested to when it is scheduled. This report is also available in business days.
• Offer Response Time – The average time in days from when an offer is made to when it is accepted. This report is also available in business days.

Cost Metrics

• Supplier Markup Ratio – The average percent of markup from the pay rate (supplier to contractor) to the bill rate (client to supplier) for assignments that started in a particular quarter.
• Submit to Request Rate Variance – The percent deviation of the offer accepted rate from the client requested rate for each supplier in a particular quarter.
• Placements Over Rate Card Count – The count of placements submitted that were over the rate card for each supplier in a particular quarter. 
• Submit Rate To Request Rate Ratio – The percent difference of the submitted rate to the requested rate.
• Placements Not Over the Rate Card Count – The count of placements submitted that were under or equal to the rate card for each supplier in a particular quarter.

Beeline VMS can support multiple rate cards for each supplier for the same position/requisition as well as for different types of labor or service. We support different markup structures (pay-to-bill and bill-to-pay) and can have rate cards that vary by position, location and supplier. There is also no limit to the variety of rates that can be incorporated into Beeline VMS rate cards. Beeline can assist the client to build out the rate cards during Implementation. Rate cards can be created and/or modified at any time via configuration. This does not require development.
 
Typically supplier rates are negotiated as part of the terms of a Supplier Master Agreement for commodity type of positions (light industrial, administrative). Therefore, all of a clients suppliers that have predefined rate cards, varied by position and location, are supported within the application. If the markup grids are provided in Beeline templates, these can be imported immediately when the supplier completes the Vendor Compliance process. In addition, there is no limit to the number of rate cards and rate card definitions, varying by different labor categories, job positions, and job locations that can be incorporated into Beeline VMS. This creates robust flexibility in managing a client's supplier community. 
",4,
Beeline,673,2018,3,1,4,"Beeline VMS supports communications by user roles and groups via email of actionable notifications and activity summaries, dashboard updates, and alerts. Automated notifications are template driven, where content may be customized by event and recipient role. Virtually every event or action, within the VMS, can generate communication by user role or security group. Content and timing are customizable. 

These notifications offer multiple options for communicating to users, such as:

• Sending automated email alerts for all activities including approvals that take place in Beeline VMS. These configurable emails are automatically generated to notify concerned parties of the electronic transmission of requests, tasks, and information, and the required action that needs to be completed. 
• Beeline VMS updates the dashboard notifications in the My To Do section with any new requests. The user is immediately alerted to high priority requests, tasks, and information when they log into Beeline VMS.

Beeline also offers multiple options for users to take action on Beeline communications:

• From an email notification, the user can log into Beeline VMS using the link provided in the email, which will take them directly to the task that requires action.
• From an email notification, the user may approve or reject any workflow (such as time approval, new request, or milestone payment) directly from their email. The end user can review all pertinent information from the email and make a decision without ever logging into Beeline VMS.
• From a dashboard, the user can select an alert and take action on the item without ever leaving the dashboard. The dashboard is updated to remove alerts once an action is taken whether the action taken is via an email response or after logging into the application.
 
Beeline VMS approach to all communications is to provide the most relevant information at the appropriate times but not inundate users to the point where they are confused or ignoring system notifications. Some key steps we take to provide the best experience for users include:

• Designating emails as action versus information notifications not requiring action.
• Allow clients to customize the content of email alerts and notifications to suit their process and business needs.
• Highlighting important actions on the dashboards with unique symbols and colors (red alert, yellow warning, neutral information).",4,
Beeline,674,2018,3,1,4,"Workflow, approval paths and notifications can be configured for any event within Beeline VMS including new requisitions, assignment extensions, terminations, transfers, or any other event requiring workflow/approval. Users are automatically notified of an event that requires their attention or approval. 

Notifications can be sent to an approver’s email, mobile device, and/or dashboard. Beeline offers a unique capability allowing a user to approve or reject any workflow item without logging into the system; a quicker and easier approval process. From the link in an email notification, the user can take required action (approve timesheet, approve a requisition, etc.).  In addition, cancelled or fulfilled requests would typically generate notifications to the associated manager and supplier. 

Workflows and notifications are typically designed during implementation to follow a client’s desired business rules; however, the content of the message and the workflow can be adjusted at any time.  Notifications can also be generated to financial approvers, internal security departments (e.g. badging credentials), or other client departments.  Approval workflows typically include:

• Hierarchical approvals
• Self-directed approvals
• Custom approvals

Some of the benefits are:

• Fully customizable workflow / approval process
­ Ability to create multi-step approval process with conditional steps (different thresholds such as approval limits, etc.)
­ Ability to support the following user actions: Approve/Reject; Notification; Unanimous Approve/Reject; Approval Notification; Rejection Notification; Task; Approval Task; Rejection Task
• Approval – Requires the user to take an accept / reject action on the event
• Task – Generates a ""task"" that the user needs to complete 
• Wait (Sync) – Causes the workflow process to halt until the task is marked as completed
• No Wait (A-Sync) – The workflow continues but the task remains on the dashboard until the task is completed
• Notifications 
­ Generates an email or dashboard notification to the user without having to wait for confirmation
­ Ability to configure email notifications using client specific terminology
• Ability to configure escalation rules

Clients will define the candidate requirements and if an individual’s profile does not meet the minimum, Beeline VMS application can be configured to automatically notify the supplier that the candidate is declined, or the client may choose to continue to send these candidates through to the self-managed program office/MSP for evaluation. In addition, candidate submittal by suppliers is tightly-controlled to ensure that only relevant, legally-permitted submittals are accepted by the tool. This enables both the program team and client users to save important time sifting through candidates. The self-managed program office/MSP can provide the first level of screening for incoming candidates from the supply chain. Once a supplier submits a candidate, a required action notification to review the resume appears on the self-managed program/MSP homepage. The self-managed program office/MSP can interactively review and filter candidates based on their level of meeting the request requirements. By qualifying only certain candidates, the self-managed program office/MSP can reduce the number of candidates sent to the hiring manager so that the hiring manager only reviews the candidates accepted or qualified by the self-managed program office/MSP. Furthermore, Beeline’s candidate management tool makes the process for hiring managers reviewing candidates quick and easy with side-by-side candidate comparisons in list, business card, and detailed compare views. Regardless of the candidate comparison view selected by the end user, pertinent details such as history, tenure, resumes, flagging, ratings, etc. can be seen within each view.

• Enhanced Resume View:  Candidate resumes are easy to preview quickly by selecting the resume icon which highlights the job title, recent experience, and any skills matched from the requisition. It also allows the user to shuffle through multiple resumes without having to close the previous one, allowing the manager to be more efficient with their time getting their positions filled more quickly
• Candidate Compare:  Side-by-side comparison of submitted candidates
• Candidate Status:  Updated to reflect the position in the qualification process
• Candidate Flags:  Visually simple indicators reflect key candidate considerations such as rate card variance, previous history, duplicate submittal, etc.
• Interview Status:  Interview activity (scheduled, completed, etc.)
• Submission Limits – Ensure appropriate submission limits are in-place and managed by the MSP on a program and request level.

Eligible and qualified candidates are submitted to the hiring manager to review and select after optional initial self-managed program office/MSP evaluation. 

Beeline VMS provides a set of ""flags"" to alert the end user of important information that is necessary at the beginning of the evaluation period. Some flags are set due to user actions (DNR/DNE) and some reflect record status (Over the Rate Card). Examples include:

• Do Not Engage – Beeline can flag candidates that have been deemed “do-not-engage”
• Duplicate Submittal – Beeline can flag if more than one supplier has submitted a particular candidate
• Rate Over the Rate Card – Beeline can flag candidates who have been submitted above the rate card
• History – Beeline can flag candidates that have been submitted and/or worked at the client before so that end users can quickly look at past performance
• Submitted for Multiple Positions – Beeline can flag a candidate that is looking at other positions within the company, enabling the company to match the candidate to the best suited position based on the company's needs.

Beeline’s Resume Preview enables the user to quickly flip through all candidates’ resumes submitted without having to go back to the Review Tool screen.

Beeline,679,2018,3,1,4,"Interview scheduling takes place through the application using Beeline’s Interview Manager to ensure all interview details are captured and consistent. Interviews can be scheduled with GoToMeeting™, Google™ Hangouts, Onsite, Phone, Skype™, or WebEx™.

Once the supplier accepts the interview, the VMS generates a V-card to the email of the hiring manager so they can easily manage multiple interviews and other meetings. For Outlook 2007 or later users, Beeline VMS takes it one-step further featuring a soft integration into the user's Outlook calendar. This provides hiring managers the ability to see free/busy time on their own Outlook calendar as well as invite other attendees to the interview.

Beeline,680,2018,3,1,4,"Beeline VMS can track and provide data such as contractor name, job type, work location and hours on the Assignment Profile screen or via reports. Each active contractor has an Assignment Profile Page that houses all activity tied to this contractor throughout the lifecycle of the assignment (i.e. amendments, extensions, timesheets, expenses, budget/spend etc.). The information captured provides a holistic view on one report so the Hiring Manager or MSP can easily access the applicable and meaningful information for each active assignment they’re managing in one centralized location. As activities/actions are occurring throughout the course of the assignment, this information will update in real time. All activity within Beeline VMS is date/time stamped and completely auditable so a complete historical overview can be captured and reported on relating to any actions that occur within the application.",4,
Beeline,681,2018,3,1,4,"Once a candidate has been selected, Beeline VMS further automates the process by allowing for online offer submission. Another ‘Did You Know?’ indicator displayed on the Candidate Offer screen, helps self-managed program offices/MSPs in the offer phase of procuring a contractor. These analytics alert self-managed program offices/MSPs into what they should be paying for a candidate with this skill set based on job titles, descriptions, and skills across a wide range of job classes, locations, and taxonomies. This intelligence can help each client drive down cost in the “offer” stage and insure you are paying a fair rate for the quality you are receiving. The last and most powerful nugget of intelligence in the second ‘Did You Know?’ shows the percentage at which the self-managed program office/MSP can lower the offer rate. This intelligence arms the self-managed program office/MSP to either minimize negotiation with the supplier or eliminate it altogether.

During the offer, the self-managed program office/MSP inputs the final rate details, start date, billing start date, and duration. Assignment start date indicates the day/date the assignment becomes active and is used for tenure tracking purposes. Billing start date is used to indicate when the assignment will begin invoicing. Once the offer has been entered and saved, this action automatically updates the candidate's status to Pending Offer and simultaneously sends an email notification to the supplier, which appears on the supplier's dashboard. 

The supplier has the option to accept or decline the offer with comments allowing for the electronic transmission and tracking of the offer process. After the supplier and the client agree on the offer amount and position dates, the requisition proceeds to the final approval and onboarding begins.

Users can adjust the filter levels to narrow or expand the candidate selection list.",4,
Beeline,683,2018,3,1,4,"Suppliers respond to requisitions by clicking on the link within their email notification or by navigating to the New Request link on their dashboard. When a supplier submits a candidate, they create an e-portfolio of the candidate detailing the candidate's experience and qualifications. The information is captured in a complete, consistent and organized manner, thus making it easier for the MSP/Hiring Manager to review the candidates submitted for the position. Required e-portfolio information is client-defined and can vary by labor type or other requirements. In addition to the entry options provided within the e-portfolio, Beeline VMS supports the attachment and transmission of documents such as resumes, project plans, credentials, etc., in order to more fully illustrate a candidate's specific qualifications for a position.

The respective Hiring Manager receives an email notification and the required action task to review the submitted resume appears on their homepage dashboard as well. The candidate’s e-portfolio can be emailed to any additional reviewers without requiring them to access the application. 

If a client prefers to route resumes directly to managers versus having the MSP review them, this is a configuration option that can be selected for either all submissions or for certain labor types (for example admin/clerical candidates may not require MSP screening).

Candidate resumes, using our enhanced resume view, are easy to preview quickly by selecting the resume icon which highlights the job title, recent experience, and any skills matched from the request.

Beeline,685,2018,3,1,4,"Beeline VMS offers multiple capabilities for managing against a budget. Once a position has been entered into Beeline, it is automatically routed through an approval hierarchy according to client-defined specifications. Approvals are based on many different factors depending on client business rules. Examples include signing limits, budget thresholds or on a cost center hierarchy. The most common approval workflow definitions used by Beeline clients are Pre-Approval and Final Approval. Pre-approval initiates after a request is created and completed by the hiring manager, but prior to release to the suppliers. Final approval initiates after a candidate is selected for a position and an offer has been extended. Exception routing and/or self-directed routing is also available to support business rules as needed.

For active assignments, Beeline VMS monitors spend thresholds amongst other indicators on a real-time basis. Dashboard notifications and email alerts provide early warnings that an assignment may run out of funds. These notifications can be configured to be sent to any role/user in the VMS. This is client-defined.

Assignments can be amended at any time to adjust the rate, either as an increase or decrease. Since this is a budget impacting amendment, management approval workflows are client-defined to notify impacted users as to the budget adjustments as well as supplier approvals for the rate change. Notifications triggered by these workflows alert users as to required tasks
",3,
Beeline,686,2018,3,1,4,"Clients may need to make changes to assignments as a result of a change in business needs. Beeline VMS includes the flexibility to have multiple workflows so that amendments will go through approvals as needed (e.g., manager approval for budget-impacting events). The Hiring Manager can make amendments or extensions to an assignment including changes to cost centers, timesheet approver(s), bill rate, work location, etc. The system offers flexibility in that one event might have its own set of workflow rules while another event has a different set, meaning that the extension, if necessary can go through a different workflow than the initial requisition creation.

Workflows for each type of change order are defined by the client’s business rules. Each change order type can invoke different workflows that can include approvals and/or notifications. For example, a cost center change may alert only the new cost center owner while an extension (which is budget impacting) may require the approval of the management chain. Depending on the modification reason selected during the amendment process the respective workflow will be initiated.

Beeline,688,2018,3,1,4,"Beeline VMS tracks both current tenure and historical tenure for workers and provides visibility via their candidate records and through standard reports. Tenure rules are setup in the VMS according to client-defined criteria and includes a defined tenure threshold limit and a break in service period (e.g. tenure cooling). Enforcement of tenure rules can also alert managers if a worker will reach their tenure threshold during the proposed assignment extension.

In order to mitigate co-employment issues, Beeline's system can accommodate contractors who are working on multiple assignments with different departments and track the continuous length of all assignments as well as breaks. This helps the client avoid co-employment issues and enables the client to generate reports on the client's tenure parameters. Access to information on Beeline will help you and your suppliers accurately track information in real-time. Furthermore, all information is time and date stamped, reducing your exposure to liability.

In addition to access to information described above, Beeline provides a standard co-employment report that can be configured to generate automatic notifications of pending terminations. Your users are alerted within 30, 60, or 90 days (as defined by the client) prior to the end of your contractors' engagements.

Additionally, we automatically notify hiring managers of individuals who have been on assignment at client locations in the past. Beeline is capable of tracking and reporting on worker tenure regardless of assignment or supplier. Our application has robust functionality, which allows us to track tenure by labor category, as well as worker breaks or gaps. Consultant tenure reports provide the client-defined break in service time in between assignments to keep within the same tenure period as established by the client. This report details a list of consultants by supplier, displays the number of weeks and years on an assignment, and allows a search based on consultant's tenure on each of their assignments. A tenure central dashboard reminds the self-managed program office/MSP and other users with appropriate access of contract workers who have a successful history with the organization and whose break in service is almost complete, allowing them to return. This tenure central dashboard offers cost savings opportunities by identifying resource options that minimize sourcing costs and training overhead.

In the application, a client administrator (this is a client-side individual) or self-managed program office/MSP user can create and manage the rights for users, including updating the security roles. The Client Administrator role provides the highest level of security available to clients in Beeline VMS. User status (active/inactive) can be manually adjusted by the Client Administrator and does not require deleting and/or recreating user records. User records associated to a financial audit trail cannot be deleted.

When Beeline VMS is implemented, there are roles that clients typically implement in the VMS. These roles can be modified to meet the client’s business needs and additional roles can be added. The roles define the visibility and permissions allowed to that role. For example, a hiring manager role may not have visibility to supplier data; however, the role permissions allow the hiring manager to amend assignments. Furthermore, visibility can be determined based on organizational hierarchy. For example, a hiring manager role may have visibility into their own data (requisitions, team activity), while an Executive role may have global visibility across the entire organization.

Beeline’s flexible application allows the Super User role to have many value added features like being a proxy to take action on pending items, review incoming resumes from the suppliers and prescreening candidates before sending on to the hiring manager, approving timesheets on behalf of another user, reviewing request information prior to sending out to supplier community and many more. The Super User does not have to log in and out of the system to take action, they would simply proxy another user or take ownership of the task. All items are date and time stamped within the application to record who took what action on which date / time and on whose behalf.

Approval Central incorporates approval tasks for Timesheets, Expenses, Milestones, Requests, and Units of Measure. Approvers are now able to complete these approvals in bulk all at once.

In addition, the VMS can support any electronic document (e.g., NDA, background, drug screen, training document, etc.), as an attachment to the individual contractor's record. A client can define if this is a required or optional activity and this can vary by labor category, country, etc. Client-defined fields can be added to candidate records for onboarding tracking and these can be required or optional.

Beeline,695,2018,3,1,4,"Beeline Time and Expense provides an online mechanism to capture, track and collect time and expenses associated with extended workforce across multiple suppliers and client departments. The web-based tool allows access for all contractors no matter their location. Resource time is captured and tracked by contractor and supplier assignment. The contractor, or supplier on behalf of the contractor enters the time worked by selecting their pay code, hours worked, projects, tasks, and any additional comments. Contractors can work on multiple assignments and allocate their time according. Projects can be allocated to multiple cost centers to enable accurate project accounting across company divisions. Contractors can also attach receipt files to the expense reports, which are then available to the manager to review as required during the approval process.

Once a timesheet is submitted, it is automatically routed to the designated approver for acceptance. Time and Expense approval screens provide a summary view of important attributes enabling quick “at a glance” approval. The approval process for time and expenses can be independent or can mirror pre-submittal or final approval. 

An alternate timesheet approver can be assigned. If the Hiring Manager does not take action, the alternate timesheet approver can review and either approve or reject the time. In addition, both the client and the supplier can view the Timesheet Status Report, which contains timesheet status information for a selected time period and identifies which timesheets have not been submitted or approved for a specific time period. 

All approved time is then included in the consolidated invoice. Any rejected time will be routed back to the contractor with an explanation for the rejection. The contractor can then adjust the timesheet accordingly and re-submit for approval.

For incomplete or inaccurate data on a submitted requision, an error message is displayed that alerts the user to what is missing in order to complete the submission. Clients can customize the displayed message. All designated required fields on a request template must be completely before a request can be submitted. Clients also have the option of creating warnings which will alert the user (based on specified conditions) but will permit the request to be submitted.

For time and expense submissions, should there be a discrepancy or question, the Hiring Manager, or designated timesheet approver, will enter notes describing the reason for rejection; the extended workforce worker will receive notification of the rejection and can make changes and resubmit the tiemcard or expense for approval.",3,

This allows the end user to pull back matching search criteria when little information is known. 

In addition, Beeline VMS provides iBubble pop-ups throughout the VMS that provide detailed information so that the hiring manager does not have to drill into multiple levels to view these details. For example, the iBubble displayed adjacent to each assignment in an assignment search results list can incorporate a variety of information fields from the initial requisition record (e.g., request type, rate card category), the candidate record (e.g., background check and citizenship status), as well as related assignment data fields. This also includes client-defined fields. Data fields displayed in iBubbles can be client defined and vary based on “point of use”. 

Information icons are also used throughout the VMS to provide additional and/or instructional information as needed. For example, users presented with a selection list for Resource Type can click on the information icon (question mark encased in a button) and a pop-up window displays listing all possible Resource Types and their associated definitions.

To provide additional emphasis for application content we can also create alert “flags” as visual indicators on specific display screens. Scrolling marquee messages are used to notify system users as to approaching downtime associated with our quarterly release cycle. And announcements can be posted on dashboard homepages for “all user” alerts.

Beeline displays approval workflow process indicators helping the user to see exactly where the requisition or assignment is at any given time in the workflow process. This actionable diagram allows the users to drill into more details to view whom the requests are pending with and if the approver has even read the email notification. From there, the user has direct access to the approver’s contact information should they need to reach out to that individual. The self-managed program office can also see (and report on) whether an approver has read the requisition in order to help alleviate any bottlenecks within the process.

Did You Know? indicators are strategically placed throughout the application providing additional details and information specific to user roles when creating requisitions and making offers. These nuggets of information are dynamic and change as the request type, job title, offer, or supplier change. Beeline’s Did You Know? library is powered by our powerful reporting engine providing unlimited opportunities for drillable details at important decision times.

Clients also have the option of attaching documents and internal training materials under the main Help Menu to provide a single access point to all needed materials, including client documentation explaining client policies and procedures. By using this single point of access, clients can ensure that users (suppliers and managers) are utilizing the most recent forms and following the most current procedures. Keeping this information current is easily accomplished by working with your Beeline Client Operations Manager should updates be necessary. Help Menus are user role specific so that access to materials can be assigned and visible per client business rules.",4,

• Designating emails as action versus information notifications not requiring action.
• Allow clients to customize the content of email alerts and notifications to suit their process and business needs.
• Highlighting important actions on the dashboards with unique symbols and colors (red alert, yellow warning, neutral information).

Warning and error messaging is available throughout the VMS and informs users exactly which information is incorrect or missing.

Approval rules may be based on an unlimited combination of variables (signing limits, budget thresholds, and cost center hierarchies). Exception routing and self-directed approvals are also available to support business rules, as needed. Users are automatically notified of an event that requires their attention and approval. Managers can approve in real-time via email notification, mobile device, or drill into the records from the task list of their dashboard.

The most common approval workflow definitions used by Beeline clients are Pre-Approval and Final Approval. Pre-approval is initiated after a requisition has been created and completed by the hiring manager, but prior to release to the suppliers. Final approval is initiated after a candidate has been selected for a position and an offer has been extended. Exception and/or self-directed routing is also available to support business rules as needed. With the self-directed approval, when a hiring manager or self-managed program office/MSP creates a requisition, the user will be prompted to select each required approver based on the level(s) of approval necessary for the position. Approval workflows can be imported and updated via file transfers if they exist in another internal system.

Beeline offers a unique capability that allows a user to approve or reject any workflow item without logging into the system resulting in a quicker and easier approval process.

Beeline supports many different attachments including Word (doc), PDF, PowerPoint, Excel (xls), htm, html, rtf, txt, gif, jpg, rm, avi, mpg, mpp, mp3. Maximum file size is 10MB per attachment.

Beeline’s Quick Request feature is ideal for hiring managers who frequently hire new contractors with the same job title, skill set, and work location. Hiring managers can save time by using Quick Request to leverage their request history and create common requests with just a few clicks. Quick Request can be easily accessed via a new Personal Dashboard widget showing the hiring manager’s four most recent requests. All fields can still be seen and edited, Quick Request simply gives hiring managers a “head start” by defaulting field values to the ones they recently used. 

The Quick Request Creation widget is added to a user's dashboard displaying four of their most recently created requests. If they cannot see the request they want to copy or want to view requests further back in their request history, they can click Show More to see four additional requests display in the Quick Request Creation widget.

Another option when the need for a contractor arises, new hiring managers or hiring managers that have infrequent hiring needs can also be guided to the appropriate worker type and location to begin the procurement process through Guide Me. Guide Me can help mitigate risk, enforce company standards, and ensure proper contractor classification.

Beeline VMS implementation’s typically find that Organization, Cost Centers, Locations, and Users are the most common integration points within a client’s enterprise environment. These integrations establish the foundation for our request and assignment approval routing, establish the hierarchy for our reporting solution and lastly drive cost allocations in our billing and invoicing function. 

Typically the requisition process for extended workforce labor starts within Beeline. However, at times it makes sense for the process to start in a client’s Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or ERP system. In these situations, the client’s Applicant Tracking System (could be an ERP or Purchasing System) are considered the system of record for the requisition and the requisition/work order is then fed to Beeline. At which point, all features of Beeline VMS are available to the hiring manager. Beeline does have standard integrations for requisitions; we would determine the integration strategy during the Initiate phase of implementation.

Beeline,703,2018,3,1,4,"Beeline can adjust the associated workflow actions to follow a client’s business rules in regards to request amendments. The requisition menu bar includes the “hold” and “cancel” options and this menu bar is active throughout the life cycle of the requisition. Reports can help the MSP Team manage/monitor requisitions placed on hold. Notification (email and/or dashboard) can be generated when the requisition status is changed to update impacted managers and suppliers. To make the user experience as simple as possible, we provide visible workflow process indicators on the requisition record so that the current status of the requisition, steps that have been completed, and steps still to be completed are easily visible.",3,
Beeline,704,2018,3,1,4,"Beeline’s Quick Request feature is ideal for hiring managers who frequently hire new contractors with the same job title, skill set, and work location. Hiring managers can save time by using Quick Request to leverage their request history and create common requests with just a few clicks. Quick Request can be easily accessed via a new Personal Dashboard widget showing the hiring manager’s four most recent requests. All fields can still be seen and edited, Quick Request simply gives hiring managers a “head start” by defaulting field values to the ones they recently used. 
 
The Quick Request Creation widget is added to a user's dashboard displaying four of their most recently created requests. If they cannot see the request they want to copy or want to view requests further back in their request history, they can click Show More to see four additional requests display in the Quick Request Creation widget.

Beeline is the first VMS provider to embed analytics that actually delivers real-time reports in the form of ‘Did You Know?’ indicators at strategic times in the procurement process to the end user. These ‘Did You Know?’ indicator reports are client-defined and provide the end user more than just data, the output delivers drillable links to critical information that has been shown to change procurement behavior. As everything within Beeline is reportable and the ‘Did You Knows’ are all driven from real-time reports, virtually anything can be provided as a ‘Did You Know’.

The ‘Did You Know?’ indicator on the Create Request screen, shows the rate ranges broken out by work location for this new requisition, how many current active assignments have this job title and how many contractors will be rolling off an assignment in the next few days that fit this job description and lastly the number of days it should take to fill this position. All of these items, especially the bullet that asserts that two contractors will be coming off an assignment in the next few days drives cost reductions. If hiring managers have targeted data like our ‘Did You Know?’ indicators visible when creating a new requisition, it is possible to skip the sourcing step all together and have a current contractor migrate from one project to the next. Not only does this save each client’s procurement department time but also money.",3,
Beeline,705,2018,3,1,4,"Beeline provides an online mechanism to collect time and expenses for temporary resources across multiple suppliers and client departments. The web-based tool (or app, if the user is entering time from their mobile device) allows access for all contractors no matter their location. The contractor, or supplier on behalf of the contractor, enters time worked by entering hours associated with specific projects, tasks and any other comments. Time can be entered directly in the application or via mobile device. The timesheet record will be date and time-stamped to indicate that the supplier submitted the record on behalf of the contractor and this will be retained for auditing purposes. Suppliers can also make adjustments to rejected timesheets/expenses on behalf of the contractor and resubmit for approval and invoicing. Contractors can work on multiple assignments and allocate their time and expenses accordingly. Time & Expense allows project time allocation to multiple cost centers enabling accurate project accounting across company divisions. Beeline VMS can manage hours and non-hours related earning codes as well as legal / collective bargaining agreements such as night bonus, special allowances, lunch voucher, etc.

For clients that use an existing time system, timesheets can also be imported in batch mode. Timesheet imports can be manual (using our timesheet import template) or they can be set up as data integration feed files from either the client or a third party provider (e.g. Clarity).

Beeline’s native mobile applications include the ability to submit time, ability for managers to approve weekly timesheets, monthly timesheets, expenses, requests, amendments, and extensions on Android and iOS smartphone devices.
",3,
Beeline,706,2018,3,1,4,"Automatic email notifications alert managers when timesheets are submitted and need their approval. Targeted for all users in any approval workflow hierarchy, the approvals via email feature enables users to take the approval action without logging into Beeline VMS resulting in a quicker and easier approval process. If you are an approver, you can approve or reject an item by simply responding to an email notification on your computer or mobile device, helping eliminate any potential delays in the approval process.

Timesheets ready for review/approval within Beeline VMS are clearly identified on the hiring manager’s dashboard with easy drill through access to the approval display screen. Security roles can be configured that provide the ability to approve time on behalf of managers. Hiring managers also have the option to assign a delegate timesheet approver permanently or for a specified period of time.  

Within the timesheet, information is displayed to the worker completing the timesheet. If there is an error, the approver will reject the timesheet and be required to enter a comment/reason for rejecting the timesheet. The timesheet will automatically be returned to the worker. There will then be an alert in the worker’s view that shows that the timesheet was rejected and the reason it was rejected.  Workers are also notified, via Beeline VMS when timesheets are missing. Beeline invoices are generated only for time approved within Beeline; missing timesheets may impact the worker’s pay.

Beeline’s Approval Central page provides approvers with the ability to approve/reject timesheets for time recorded, requests, etc. directly in Beeline in mass.

Beeline can display the combined timesheet hours for the timesheet approver, however the approver will also only see the assignment and timesheet details that they responsible for. Beeline’s strategy is to provide our users with instant access to time-sensitive data and reporting on the go. 

Beeline offers mobile approvals in several capacities including:

•  Web: Users can securely approve or reject any system initiated approval workflow from their dashboard on a tablet.
•  Email Approvals (Smartphone): Users can securely approve or reject any system initiated approval workflow directly from their smartphone without logging in to the system. 
•  Native Applications: Users can securely approve timesheets and expense vouchers and, to ensure compliance with approval policies, users can access all the details for the timesheet or expense report from their mobile app on their mobile device.

Timesheets approved via mobile device are approved 75% faster than traditional approval within Beeline VMS and are 23% more likely to be approved in less than a day.

Beeline,708,2018,3,1,,"Through Beeline’s robust reporting platforms and our real-time dashboard functionality, users are able to have visibility into any timesheet gaps. Beeline also provides standard missing timesheet reports. Beeline can be configured to generate email notifications for past due events / items.

Beeline’s strategy is to provide our users with instant access to time-sensitive data and reporting on the go. Beeline can support approvals via email notification or via a mobile device. Approvers can approve an item by simply responding to an email notification without having to log into Beeline VMS. All transactions are date/time/user stamped and stored within the application for auditing purposes. When a step in the workflow requires approval, an email is sent to all approvers with a link that allows them to approve and add comments from their email. Additionally, timesheets can be approved individually or in batches.

Beeline VMS posts notifications to the supplier’s dashboard alerting the supplier of actions required from the contractor. Suppliers also have the ability to generate a “supplier view” missing timesheet report to track outstanding time. ",3,

Beeline,710,2018,3,1,4,"Beeline VMS can be configured to support shifts and rate cards can be related to various shift times.  Beeline VMS supports different rate structures based on shift differentials, rate uplifts, region, job title, suppliers, skill set, etc. Experience levels are indicated within rate cards by using the Rate Card Category Level I or Level II data field. Additionally the application supports different rate types such as bill rate range, markups (bill-to-pay or pay-to-bill), not to exceed rates, etc. The rate card strategy can also differ by labor type. Rate cards can be imported using our Rate Card import template or can be manually created as needed. There are no limits to the number of levels (with their associated rates) that can be created.",4,
Beeline,711,2018,3,1,4,"Beeline’s consolidated invoice includes only approved time.  

Beeline typically sends one consolidated invoice file that may consist of one or many invoices. This file will be transmitted to a client after the close of their defined billing cycle. However, a preliminary invoice is created prior to the final invoice. This preliminary invoice alerts the client to any missing timesheets or other data and provides an opportunity for review and corrections to ensure accuracy in the final invoice. The invoice runs as a separate process outside the workflow structure. It does not require an approval but it does incorporate validation scripts to ensure that invoice processes follow the client's business rules. If the validation scripts identify errors then an error log is generated for reconciliation prior to running the final invoice. A final invoice is not generated until all errors are corrected. 

Each invoice itemizes the total amount per defined client requirements. The invoice includes only the time/expenses and milestones approved within Beeline during the billing cycle. This invoice also breaks out the amount due to each supplier; thereby eliminating the need for suppliers to send separate invoices. This is beneficial as it cancels the invoice processing and reconciliation costs associated with comparing invoices to what the client is expected to pay. 
 
The fields included in the consolidated invoice are client-defined. Beeline can sort the consolidated invoice by hiring manager, business unit, or project and typically includes the following details:

• Contractor
• Cost Center
• Project Code
• Supplier
• Hours Worked (Regular Time/Overtime)
• Rate (Regular Rate/Overtime Rate)
• Total Amount
• Taxes
• Discounts
• Adjustments
 
Beeline’s out of the box validations check primarily for things that would prevent the invoice from calculating correctly or completely. Typically, these include items such as when a worker is set-up with multiple assignments and the assignments have conflicting rate/Overtime information; when the data provided contains inactive cost center or project data or when any required item, such as a PO number is missing.

Accounts Payable system validations that are required for invoice processing will be reviewed and determined during Implementation. These will be added to the invoice process so that any invalid data is identified prior to the generation of the final invoice. Error records are provided to the self-managed program/MSP team for correction. A client may opt for a preliminary invoice to identify validation errors prior to final invoice processing.

Once the invoice is submitted to the AP system, the invoice is locked. Should there be a need; the self-managed program/MSP team may reprocess timesheet/s due to errors. The following invoice will clearly show any reprocessed timesheets. The invoice can show two distinct lines for the adjustment, the first being a credit and the second for the new debit amount. This method keeps a clean and detailed audit history of all financial transactions.

Beeline also provides an Accrual Report to aid with monthly reporting of expenses related to client extended workforce spend. We have also successfully integrated with ERP solutions including PeopleSoft, Oracle Financials, SAP, etc. 

",4,
Beeline,712,2018,3,1,4,"Through automatic notifications and workflow configuration in Beeline, all onboarding activities are tracked and monitored for completion. Beeline automatically sends notifications to the client-defined parties (HR, Security, MIS, etc.) informing the individuals of onboarding tasks requiring attention. The client will have direct access to this information and can task others throughout the organization with managing this responsibility through configurable visibility/roles. Our capabilities include configuring our workflow engine to support the business processes, including a partially automated process up to a fully integrated automated process.

In addition, the VMS can support any electronic document (e.g., NDA, background, drug screen, training document, etc.), as an attachment to the individual contractor's record. A client can define if this is a required or optional activity and this can vary by labor category, country, etc. Client-defined fields can be added to candidate records for onboarding tracking and these can be required or optional. The VMS maintains this information and can be audited by the MSP for compliance.

Beeline VMS has the ability to integrate with third-party background check vendors to help automate a client’s manual process occurring today. Beeline sends a notification containing the candidate name and email address to the third-party company. Once the candidate information is completed with the background check vendor, the pass/fail information is fed back to Beeline to update within the application and the onboarding process will begin.

Beeline,713,2018,3,1,4," With Beeline’s Assignment Assessment Questionnaire feature, questionnaires can be created from templates for completion at defined intervals by specified individuals such as the hiring manager, timesheet approver or project manager, for example. Each questionnaire is client-specific and may be created by an MSP or client administrator.

Similar to the ease of using Beeline’s requisition template, Beeline’s questionnaire templates provide the basics that can be customized to meet each client’s needs. An MSP/client administrator can create the questionnaire to be completed at specific intervals, including, but not limited to:

• 30/60/90 Day Intervals
• Assignment Worker Offboarding Review
• Assignment Warranty Period Review
• 12-month Assignment Review

Once the questionnaire(s) is created, the specified individual(s) (hiring manager, timesheet approver, etc.) will receive an email notification as well as notice posted to the “My To Do” section of the user’s dashboard. Once completed, the questionnaire(s) are easily accessible for reviewer(s) to view the results. 

Beeline’s Assignment Assessment Questionnaire feature provides clients the ability to solicit, assess and evaluate feedback throughout the assignment. With this feature, clients minimize co-employment factors and ensure workers are evaluated on a regular basis. 

All information related to a worker’s assignment and performance is stored in Beeline VMS with this feature.

Beeline,789,2018,3,1,5,"Clients can opt for a standard implementation of Beeline's Services Procurement solution or our new Rapid Deployment. With our rapid timeline, we work with clients to determine which processes, integrations, and data transitions are truly vital. We apply best practices, not only for system implementation, but for change management, training, and stakeholder communications as well. Then we implement the system—doing all the big and little things required to ensure that the VMS meets program management and end user requirements. Our rapid deployment timeline maintains the same four phases as in a conventional VMS implementation, but we have condensed the timeline significantly because the baseline is a standardized solution.

After a readiness session with our Solutions Design team, we utilize a work packet that allows the client to easily see our industry standard practices and select from a variety of configuration options that make the most sense for their organization. Working intensively with their program team, we prepare the system and data required to meet their immediate needs and conduct the necessary training for key users. After successfully completing user acceptance testing, their VMS goes live.

Once the Services Procurement solution is up and running, clients have the abilty to perform a number of configurations that are self-service such as:

- Creating and managing SOW templates and Competitive Bid templates
- Managing Competitive Bid categories
- Outlining Categories that match a client's labor groups, like Marketing, Development, or Quality Assurance
- Defining Types that match your organization’s activities, such as Legal, Financial, or General, to tag and organize terms by the kind of work to be completed

The Terms and Agreement will be stored in Beeline along with an audit history of date/time stamps of the acceptance by each supplier user.

The Supplier Profile Screen in Beeline VMS provides quick and efficient access to a summary profile of each supplier in a client's program. The display screen is divided into quadrants, each with a different informational focus. The standard format includes the following sections:

• Information: This quadrant contains basic information about the supplier including diversity status and all associated industries.
• Financial: This quadrant displays the financial trend for the supplier in chart format with drill down functionality to additional details.
• Activity: This quadrant contains a set of tabbed reports showing activity data such as active contractors, pending interviews, open requests, and top five jobs.

Beeline,799,2018,3,1,3,"Beeline VMS provides comprehensive Competitive Bid and SOW capabilities. Templates are at the core of both solutions. The process begins with a Competitive Bid (if supplier has yet to be selected). The Competitive Bid will draw from a template that defines: Core Data, Contributors, Terms, Questions, and Financials. The completed Competitive Bid is available for response by the appropriately classified suppliers. Based upon supplier responses, and the review of questions and financials, a winning supplier is selected.

Beeline is dedicated to supporting the continuity of the “procure-to-pay” process. Once a supplier is awarded the business based on a Competitive Bid, key details on the bid, such as financial information which can include milestone/deliverable, units of measure, and billable roles will be promoted to a SOW. Additional key details such as bid information, supplier information, and contributors will also carry over to the SOW. Beeline VMS helps to further streamline the process by promoting all SOW information over to the active project where the manager can begin to manage the project from a single profile screen.

In the event a supplier is known up front, the user can easily begin with creating the SOW directly instead of the Competitive Bid.   

Our system is designed to build, manage, and track SOWs through completion and payment. Templates expedite the process by applying “burned in” legal terms or copies from previous templates.

These elements (terms/milestones) can be locked down so that suppliers cannot make changes. A comments section provides the ability for all users to maintain a conversation about the content without changing approved terms/clauses and financial details.

Once the collaborative process of building the SOW is complete, the final approval triggers the system-driven creation of an active project. The Project Profile contains all of the needed information to manage the lifecycle of the project until completion. This profile includes all of the financial details associated with the work to be performed by the supplier. As work becomes billable (milestone completed, timesheet entered, unit of measure allocated) the supplier records their completion as a request for payment. This request typically includes attachments, acceptance criteria, and any substantiation required to confirm the client is obligated to pay. The sum of this activity is recorded within a consolidated invoice. The consolidated invoice presents a line item level report/file that is suitable for AP processing.

All of this activity is monitored through project completion. This leads to a broad range of status reporting, performance metrics, and other meaningful data sets, all of which are visible via dashboards or scheduled reports.

Each platform presents unique benefits, and they can be mixed and matched to achieve the best results. Both platforms are secure and reliable. 

Beeline’s iPaaS supports a variety of file format types (XML, CSV, flat-file), transport protocols (FTPS, SFTP, HTTPS, EDI, AS2), encryption approaches and has many industry standard connectors built-in for leading enterprise applications, such as Oracle, SAP, Workday, and ServiceNow.

Our Beeline iPaaS toolkit, powered by Boomi from Dell, delivers flexibility and speed. Deeply embedded into Beeline VMS, Beeline’s iPaaS allows us to implement on project timelines rather than software release cycles, make updates at any time, and provide an immediate response to a client's evolving business needs. 

Beeline’s iPaaS is a game changer in the industry by reducing integration timelines significantly. Other key differentiators are: 

• Drag-and-drop process and data mapping
• User entered business logic
• New integrations and changes in days, not weeks
• Fast and accurate testing
• No software release required

Beeline’s Web Service integrations is built as RESTful APIs using HTTP methods and a RESTful endpoint structure. The Beeline Web Service security framework uses either HMAC or X.509 Digital Certificate Thumbprint. Requests are formatted in JSON and the APIs return JSON-formatted responses.

Beeline's current Competitive Bid solution provides the functionality needed to competitively source and evaluate bids. This includes helping our clients better manage the content of a Competitive Bid, which is sent out to suppliers, through approvals, workflows, and visibility. 

Through the use of pre-defined templates, the user’s experience in creating the competitive bid can be relatively streamlined. There are standard information fields that need to be completed for the competitive bid. This information then carries over to a SOW once a bid has been awarded to a supplier, eliminating duplicate data entry.

Once the general information has been completed, the user is able to submit for initial approval. This is an optional approval and can be client defined as to when the approval should happen. 

Once approvals have been completed, the user can build out the details and assessment portion of the competitive bid. As stated earlier, through the use of templates, the information can be pre-populated depending on criteria such as the category of service or supplier.

If an invited supplier is awarded the bid, then they will need to complete the vetting process before they can move forward to the SOW phase.

Minimum Supplier Thresholds
Corporate policies often dictate the number of suppliers to which a competitive bid must be extended. That policy ensures the minimum number of vendors/suppliers are invited to participate in the sourcing process. Client admins can establish thresholds via the Services Procurement Self-Service menu. Client users and MSPs are alerted when a competitive bid doesn’t meet the programs compliance requirements.

Open Bidding Option
Competitive bid processes can use open or closed bidding. We have found that some clients don’t need to adhere to bid deadlines. Those clients can choose to use an open bid process. Open bidding lets Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and Self-Managed Programs review a bid as soon as it’s submitted rather than wait for the bid to move into an Evaluation status.

Multi-Round Bidding
Identifying which vendor to award the final bid during a competitive bid process sometimes requires more than a single round of questions and responses. Multiple rounds in a single bid process are helpful for a variety of reasons. They can help narrow down the decision process between similar vendors, expand the vendor pool when no potential awardee can be determined, or give the vendors the opportunity to revise their bid when the client is looking to realize more savings, to name a few. Regardless of the reason, multiple rounds are a useful tool and an overall timesaver during the competitive bid process.

During the evaluation phase of a Competitive Bid, the client can create additional rounds of vendor questions for assessment review. A tab, Related Rounds, in the Information quadrant on the Competitive Bid record provides easy access to all “rounds."" The Start New Round link displays in the upper left quadrant when the status of the Competitive Bid is “evaluation” and provides easy access to initiate the process. The client can also initiate a new round directly from the Competitive Bid ribbon in the More Actions pull-down menu list by selecting the Start New Round option. On the Welcome tab, the client has the option to copy the previous round. The mouseover iBubble indicates exactly which information from the previous round will be copied over. Or, clicking “No” allows the client to create a new round from scratch.",3,

Post Questions
Before submitting their bid, the supplier can post their Q&A questions. Once submitted, they cannot post additional questions. 

Assessment
The supplier must answer these questions as part of the bid.

Financials
The supplier will add their estimated milestones and resource spend on the 'Financials' tab.
• Milestones are captured on the Fixed Bid section. The level of detail required depends on the client but suppliers can enter:
-Proposed milestone names by type
-Dollar Amounts
-Payment Schedule
-Acceptance criteria

Define Terms
Beeline VMS offers the capability to lock specific content so suppliers cannot alter the information, thus allowing the client to control the negotiation process. 

Define SOW Financials
Suppliers have the ability to assign time and material based resources to a SOW where they could be required to pass any client onboarding requirements, as well as enter time/expenses into Beeline’s Time and Expense System or other client-identified time entry system. Beeline can then provide a consolidated invoice for billable time worked against the project. Resources can also be tied to a project in a non-billable capacity.

Milestones/deliverables can be entered individually, or if a milestone/deliverable is anticipated to occur multiple times during the life of the project, the supplier (or manager) can set up a schedule of milestones/deliverables to occur with a given start and end date, appropriate interval for the occurrence, and amount of the milestone/deliverable to occur. Beeline will set up a schedule based on those details.

As the supplier completes the milestone/deliverable, suppliers can request payment for full or partial amount based on the milestone/deliverable, which can then move through a client-defined approval process. Once approved, all milestone/deliverable payments will show on the consolidated invoice.

If desired, the non-billable resources can also enter time and expenses within Beeline. From a reporting perspective, analysis can then be done on the number of hours worked by those non-billable resources and Beeline can easily identify if there is any rogue spend that is uncovered.

During the SOW creation process, our application creates an initial engagement cost; usually this is an estimated cost as final negotiations with the selected supplier will determine final budget cost. Once finalized and promoted to an active project, Beeline can establish a process to initiate and support the PO submission and generation activity via a bi-directional data exchange. This bi-directional integration would allow the Beeline application to submit a transaction to a client’s system (for most clients, this is the financial system) requesting the establishment of a PO record and related PO number. This data exchange would include all required information to complete the transaction (e.g., cost center, engagement contract amount, dates, etc.) in a client’s system and then pass back to Beeline’s application any pertinent data (e.g., PO number). Subsequent changes made to the engagement (amendments, billing, etc.) can follow the same process to keep the systems in sync. We currently support this process for clients who secure the PO during the completion of the requisition or SOW and prior to the workflow approval process as well as for clients who secure the PO only upon completion of the approval process.

Beeline supports the ability to track, manage and negotiate milestone acceptance criteria to ensure accurate payments and SLA's are adhered to. Milestones/deliverables and units of measure are defined as part of the scope requirements within a SOW. Typically, the supplier enters milestone/deliverable criteria; including recurring milestones; however, this can be done collaboratively with the manager. Milestone acceptance criteria can and often include SLAs. The number of recurrences desired, the calendar interval for the recurrences (e.g. weekly, monthly), and the recurrence start date are entered. The recurring milestones are then presented in a summary view for the user to review before they ‘click’ “create” to generate the milestone schedule. Once the recurring milestones have been scheduled, they appear in the list of milestones on the Project – Milestone screen. Once a SOW is finalized, all scope details are promoted into an active project where they can be actively managed based on acceptance criteria agreed to between the manager and supplier.

Seperate from Beeline's Services Procurment solution is Beeline's Resource Tracking solution. Resource Tracking is a simple alternative to full sourcing automation and enables clients to achieve compliance and visibility into headcount and supplier engagement across their company. With Resource Tracking a client can:

• Quantify unmanaged spend easily on all extended workforce that are not sourced through the program.
• Know all workers and their suppliers who have access to your data, systems and buildings.
• Ensure compliance with organizational policies by automating onboarding and offboarding processes for every labor type.
• Expose and mitigate tenure and other policy risks related to previously untracked resources.
• Establish a consistent process for identifying and reporting on all extended workforce resources.

Resource Tracking Features and Capabilities

Tracking

Beeline will provide the ability to track and report on extended workforce workers by capturing a small subset of required fields (i.e. Name, Location, Job Title, Supplier, Start/End Dates, Hiring Manager, Bill Rate, etc.). This includes the standard data fields contained in the application including client defined fields and region-specific data as noted in the project requirements phase.
Resource Management

Resource Tracking provides a centralized repository to capture auditable information on all extended workforce workers who have access to the organization’s physical and intellectual assets. The client defines the business rules that control the flow of workers through the engagement creation and expiration process. The following capabilities comprise Resource Management, but do not represent an exhaustive feature set: Resource Headcount, Bulk Upload to Resource Pool, Amendments and Extensions.

Onboarding

Resource Tracking allows automation of onboarding activities such as background checks, asset management, and access management to ensure compliance with the client’s organizational policies. The following capabilities comprise Onboarding, but do not represent an exhaustive feature set: Third-Party Background Check integration, HRIS system integration, Onboarding Notifications and Alerts.

Offboarding

Resource Tracking allows automation of processes for properly offboarding workers when they are terminated. The following capabilities comprise Offboarding, but do not represent an exhaustive feature set: HRIS system integration (e.g., initiate deactivation of building access), Offboarding Notifications and Alerts.

Compliance

Resource Tracking allows automation of compliance processes. The following capabilities comprise Compliance, but do not represent an exhaustive feature set: Background Check Requirements and Tracking, Tenure Requirements and Enforcement, and Credentialing.

Recertification

Resource Tracking allows automation of the process for verifying that all extended workforce workers are still engaged with the client through the supplier on file. The hiring manager and supplier receives a request to validate that extended workforce workers are still active and must respond within the client-defined time periods (for example, if the client requires that suppliers verify every three months). The following capabilities comprise Recertification, but do not represent an exhaustive feature set: Supplier Request for Validation and Recertification Workflow.

Supplier Access Agreement

Before access can be granted, suppliers must accept the Supplier Access Terms on the Resource Tracking Solution, which is presented in a click-through agreement upon initial login. The following capabilities comprise Supplier Access Agreement, but do not represent an exhaustive feature set: Online Agreement and Date/Time Acceptance.

Reporting 

Beeline will provide reporting for purposes of tracking resources, compliance activities, onboarding and offboarding of resources.  Additional relevant support of reporting needs will be defined during the implementation phase of the project.

Suppliers are provided with similar, client-approved reports within Beeline.

Beeline,877,2018,3,1,5,"Beeline offers clients (based on user roles, including procurement professionals, hiring managers, and suppliers) an instant and detailed view into the areas that matter most to that particular individual by way of a customizable dashboard. For example, we offer a requisition dashboard that provides real-time visibility into open, pending, and on hold requests, and all relevant information that relates to requests.

Key items are provided via a set of ""dashboard parts"" or categorical libraries. Each part is responsible for displaying specific information from the database (e.g., open requisitions, assignments that are due to expire, etc.). Dashboard parts can be combined in order to form a dashboard profile. Some of the predefined dashboard profiles are:

• Executive Dashboard: The Executive Dashboard allows top company executives to view key metrics regarding their extended workforce program. The focus of the executive dashboard is to relay high-level statistics about extended workforce and supplier usage, as well as to provide an overall picture of the company's extended workforce management program.
• Financial Dashboard: The Financial Dashboard allows those with financial responsibilities the ability to view key financial metrics in respect to the extended workforce and supplier management program. Key areas such as current spend data and future spend forecasts are vital parts of the financial dashboard.
• Program Management Office (PMO) Dashboard: The Program Management Office (PMO) Dashboard allows the self-managed program office/MSP team to view detailed data about your extended workforce activity.  Key areas such as request and assignment activity assist hiring managers through their respective procurement processes enabling them to keep track of all program data on a real-time basis.
• Hiring Manager Dashboard: The Hiring Manager Dashboard allows hiring managers to quickly identify all items that require their attention and to take action directly from the dashboard. In most cases, the dashboard parts include “My To Do”, “My Calendar”, “My KPIs”, and “Timesheet Management”.
• Supplier Dashboard: The Supplier Dashboard allows suppliers to quickly identify all items that require their attention and to take action directly from the dashboard. In most cases, the dashboard parts include “My To Do”, “My Calendar”, and “Timesheet Management”.

New dashboards can be created at any time with the ability to customize the dashboard default view to match the user role (e.g. my dashboard). Users can have multiple dashboards that they can easily toggle between as needed. In addition, Beeline offers the ability to combine dashboard parts from different modules into one integrated dashboard.

Beeline provides drill-down and charting capabilities through the Beeline dashboards. These dashboards are built using our powerful Report Builder engine and provide our clients an instant and detailed view into the areas that matter most to them. It is important to note that Beeline’s dashboards are both informational and actionable. All Beeline dashboard parts are “drillable,” meaning access to the underlying detail is at your fingertips and a user never has to leave the dashboard to take action on items requiring their attention. For example, you may wish to display the number of timesheets awaiting approval on your dashboard. One click on the number will bring you to the detail that will allow you to take action on the timesheets.

Beeline,1000,2018,3,1,3,"Beeline Self-Sourcing automatically and instantaneously presents pre-vetted talent from a greatly expanded pool of candidates without disrupting a client's traditional sourcing model.

In addition to accessing public talent pools (Genesys, Interactive Resources, Jobaio, etc.) Beeline offers clients the ability to build their own private pool of talent - Clients attract, collect, and curate their own talent pools with software, such as TalentNet, that helps them communicate, invite to apply, and organize talent then stream that talent directly into Beeline Self-Sourcing.

With the TalentNet partnership our clients can build pools of talent from known candidates, but also capitalize on their own brands as a method for attracting talent to temporary positions through their own web sites. These private talent pools, powered by TalentNet, can connect to a client’s ATS and have robust workflow support on the administration side. The TalentNet offering is integrated into Beeline Self-Sourcing.

Another option that is currently available for private talent pools is Beeline’s own software, Beeline To Work. Though not as robust as the TalentNet offering, clients can get their known talent out of excel files and into a software that helps them communicate, invite to apply, and organize candidates from their retiree programs, employee referrals, silver medalists, etc. The client’s goals for their private talent pool will help guide which private talent pool technology is most fitting. 

Beeline + TalentNet

• VMS Integration and Data - Curator can see who in the talent pool is “on assignment” already and who is available now. Candidate is fully engaged with an Apply-to-Offer integration with VMS, and talent pool is responsive to VMS GDPR erasure request (both are only available with Beeline VMS).
• Job Publishing - With automated job board publishing, including LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Corporate Careers page, a client's contract opportunities are easily found.
• All Brand-Attracted Talent Channels - Clients aren’t limited to known contingent alumni. They can attract talent to their brand through public channels and programs for retirees, referrals, interns, and silver medalists.
• AI Powered Candidate Experience - Simple sign up, LinkedIn profile data integration, Artificial Intelligence based job-matching, Google Job Discovery (private beta ML job search), Refer Friends, In-App Communication, and Custom Emails, ensure a client's brand is represented in the best light and reaches the most candidates.
• Talent Curation and Engagement - These tools enable cleints to make their talent pool a strategic program asset: Global talent pool performance dashboard, Google Profile Discovery (closed Alpha ML candidate search), automated candidate categorization, application workflow management, view/share candidates and pools with peers, customized micro talent pools, record candidate notes, send talent pool invitations, use advance candidate source tracking to measure channel effectiveness (e.g., careers page, Indeed, Google Jobs, VMS alumni, etc.).

The visual style/brand is baked into the core Design System. For inspiration we look to relevant marketplace experiences and web-based power applications as well as their mobile app counterparts.

Sirion utilizes AI, NLP, and machine learning to build following competencies
1. To automatically extract metadata and obligations from contract documents written in natural language
2. To automatically pull related and alternative clauses from enterprise clause library into the contract and perform easy replacements
3. To automatically read each clause in the contract and suggest clause category, allowing intuitive update of clause library with new variations as well as comparison with existing variations in the same category
4. To interprets charts and data and provides analysis in text form

Audit trails of all transactions are viewable as logs and/or reports.

We have full backups on a daily basis during off-hours.  In addition, we also conduct differential backups every hour and a transaction log backup every 30 minutes.  All upgrades and patches also require a full backup prior to applying the patches. The data is stored onsite and then moved offsite at the end of every month. The full and incremental backups are retained for 3 months. Thereafter, only the full backups are retained for another 6 months and then the backup is stored and archived in AWS glacier for long term access and audit.  Smart Track uses Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) as the cloud backup storage provider.

Transactional data is archived every quarter if it is older than 7 years. However, for reporting, the data warehouse always contains the data and it is not purged.

For SOW-based contract services, predefined metrics that have been found very effective include accuracy in tracking all approvals, change order management, tracking resources against task orders, billing hours by resources against different task orders, expense reporting, and tracking deliverables and invoicing based on different milestones, and tracking of funding allocated to PO/Task order.  In addition, SOW KPIs typically include compliance with onboarding for all resources working on SOW projects, time to fulfill task orders by suppliers, and burn chart tracking for projects.

 

Supplier Scorecard Reports included within Smart Track can be configured to track up to 25 key client-defined supplier performance measurements.  Clients can weight each metric, generating an overall supplier score and ranking the supplier against the entire supply base or a selected group of suppliers. At the client’s discretion, separate metrics can be configured and contracted with specialty service firms, small businesses, diversity suppliers or short-term providers of service.

Smart Track encourages high user adoption and engagement through ease of use features, motivational elements, and compliance controls.
Smart Track employs common social media techniques, extensive help features at every work step, and other ease of use features that enable users to rapidly come up to speed and to use the system with minimal assistance from the program administrators or MSP staff (hence, driving self-service). 
Sleek dashboards are highly configurable, giving clients and suppliers access to a single place for notification of required activities and a graphical and interactive investigation of their workforce data. Dashboards are role-specific, with content access determined by role.  Users can fully configure dashboard views, controlling the layout, charts and tables to be presented, and fields to be included in up to 8 dynamic quadrants.  Requests for action, notifications and alerts are automatically posted in the dashboard also includes To Do Lists (also delivered by email and text). Smart Track works with multiple calendaring systems using the .ics format to provide a calendar view within the Dashboard.  This includes Outlook, Google Calendar and iCalendar.  System Alerts are shown on the dashboards to notify all users of upcoming release schedules or other system-related events, or to deliver market intelligence information.
 
DCR has introduced ""gamification"" features, a feature unique in the industry, into Smart Track to encourage user adoption and reduce ""rogue"" spend (hence, cost savings).  Users are engaged and incentivized to perform all sorts of tasks by gamifying simple and critical processes (e.g., users receive a reward/token of appreciation for entering time cards early/on time). This creates an engaging experience by using badges, points, and leaderboards to excite users and promote compliance with process needs. These efforts help users not only to participate, but also retains their attention. Our clients use a mixture of different types of rewards, including monetary compensation, special parking spaces, additional time off, or prizes such as restaurant certificates to drive these efforts.
 
Clients can introduce business rules and require use of the system in order to request or source temporary workers.  When clients use this approach, compliance occurs from linking Smart Track to the ERP systems so that payments are triggered through invoices issued by Smart Track.

Coupa,1094,2018,3,1,5,"DCR encourages clients to integrate Smart Track with their internal ERP, Financial and HCM/HRIS systems. Smart Track's integration toolkit includes pre-built Connectors to leading industry time tracking, HRIS and ERP systems.  

Smart Track fully supports data exchange (upload and download data transfer) via flat text files and APIs. For flat text files, it supports both delimiter and fixed width formats.  For file transfer to directories using SFTP, the generation is in the form of CSV with delimiters defined in the toolkit (e.g. pipe, comma etc.) and text qualifiers using quotes. The files are encrypted using PGP over RSA.

The API connections include mass uploads through API, use of web services (REST API, XML/SOAP) as well as SFTP and HTTPS protocols. Smart Track’s published REST-based APIs expose both product objects as well as actions for integrations. Smart Track also supports Batch-based ETL.  In addition, Smart Track also uses the Publisher-Subscriber (Pub-Sub) pattern for integrations which lets the external systems handle their own schedule of publishing or reading the data. 

On average, Smart Track is integrated with five internal systems for each client.  More than 40 integrations have been established for one client.  The APIs are typically related to:
• Master data administration: Smart Track has APIs which allow master data to be administered using web services. The APIs allow the CRUD operations and the audit trail is tracked for the master data updates.
• SOW Project-based API: The SOW Project-based APIs let projects be defined in external systems and the APIs transfer the project data to Smart Track. The contracts, SLAs and tracking can be done in any external system and transferred to Smart Track.
• Workforce Management: All onboarding, off-boarding and worker changes are available as services.
• Invoice & Payment: The invoices and payments are exposed as REST API.
• Organization Hierarchy and Financial Hierarchy: The organization and financial hierarchy can be updated within Smart Track through the services.
• Callback API for Calendar: Smart Track offers calendar API to be called by Google calendar and Office 365 calendar so that changes in the user’s own calendar are visible within Smart Track.

• DCR does recommend integrations with HR and HRIS systems to track hierarchies, owners of program, spend level, HRBP etc.

• For accounting and financial systems we do recommend integration with A/P, A/R systems and to conduct real-time charge validations

• On project side we do recommend integration with Project charter, charge accounts, WBO's etc.

• To support onboarding it is recommended to integrate with asset provisioning systems, badging, drug, background check system.

• For quality control the VMS should should integrate with surveys, feedback.,Testing  etc. systems.

Besides APIs, Smart Track also uses the Pub-Sub pattern for integrations (Publisher-Subscriber pattern) which lets the external systems handle their own schedule of publishing or reading the data. This also reduces incidents related to connectivity and data loss.

Coupa,1107,2018,3,1,4,"Smart Track offers comprehensive analytics capabilities that go beyond operational reporting. Our capabilities will identify gaps where clients can reduce costs, improve operations and increase visibility in the following areas: 
• Rate benchmarking – Rate cards can be configured to be pay rate cards, or markups. When entering a new requirement, Smart Track uses external benchmark data to show competitive pay ranges for that assignment based on role and location.  Market rate info is gathered from 'crawlers 'that review open websites and original research into contingent labor supply/demand conducted by DCR.  The Client’s job titles are mapped to a standard job title and the locations are mapped to a MSA (Metro Statistical Area). Using this information, Smart Track’s spider software finds these positions and associated rates. N-dimensional analyses are then conducted to establish and compare rates by category, supplier, organization, division, department, or service. Rate/cost/fair market and rate variance analyses are also conducted. Benchmarking is done for pay and bill rates as well as mark-ups.  When a requisition is created, Smart Track automatically shows market rates for that job title and location.
• Cycle time benchmarking – Process cycle times are baselined during the first three months of the engagement, and performance metrics are established for each area needing improvement by considering industry benchmarks and the client’s desired levels of performance. Smart Track automatically measures cycle times and process times for every step in each process at every location for both supplier and internal processes. Actual process times and cycle times are benchmarked against the lowest and average times. Results are available through standard process time analysis reports which typically are issued and reviewed monthly. 
• SOW project analysis – Reports relevant to project burn rates, SLA tracking and operational deliverables are available. 
• Metrics-based reports – trending, scoring and ranking based on different performance metrics. Reports merge aggregate client statistics with general market data for benchmarking purposes. 
• “What if” scenarios – spend forecasting, resource mix analysis, and bill rate adjustment analysis. 
• Comparative business intelligence reports – comparisons between periods such as quarter to quarter change or same quarter year over year change. Smart Track queries can be saved, enabling clients to create snapshots of data at a given time, with anytime access, to report and analyze trends over time. 
• Active requirements analysis – Smart Track delivers analytical data to be used in weekly requirements reviews. This consolidated data includes analyses of candidate match, candidate status, bill and pay rate submissions ranges, and related data that identifies potential areas requiring attention.

Clients can ""follow"" a candidate who is on assignment elsewhere, being notified when the individual will be available.  

Profiles of former workers are automatically entered into the system for rapid reassignment, minimizing downtime between assignments. Smart Track automatically verifies that tenure gap policies have been met before submitting a former worker as a candidate for a new position.

If desired, potential candidates can connect and collaborate with suppliers for temporary positions seeking agency-supplied contractors, resulting in increased business and career opportunities. 

 When a candidate is selected from Smart Track xCHANGE, acceptance of the assignment automatically triggers the generation of an onboarding checklist appropriate for that position.

Post-interview, Smart Track captures standard information regarding the interview date, time and attendees, overall assessment, recommended next steps and general comments.  This information can be automatically forwarded to other approvers. After the interview, feedback from the hiring manager is available electronically to the supplier. If selected, the client or DCR would negotiate all assignment conditions with the staffing agency, including start and end date, compensation, and any other conditions that might be unique to the candidate or position.  This information is entered into the contractor's profile.  Information in the requirement also becomes part of the profile, and forms the basis for calculation of payments, tenure tracking, etc.

Suppliers are given a performance score and ranked against other suppliers providing similar services (defined by skill/location) or against the overall supply base.

In addition, all new suppliers must participate in our vigorous mandatory vetting and selection process. When the new supplier initially registers in the portal, they must provide identifying business information including evidence of relevant industry or skills experience, locations covered, ability to conduct background checking, drug screening, testing, etc. The new supplier is required to provide evidence that they are a viable business that can meet both our qualitative and quantitative sourcing needs.

Coupa,669,2018,3,1,4,"Smart Track supports a wide range of requisition distribution strategies, including sole source, a tiered broadcast, round robin process, all-inclusive broadcast and metrics-based broadcast. The VMS also supports a hybrid of these supplier management processes based on parameters such as department, organization, job category or other factors specified by the client. In addition, client-specified conditions can determine supplier distribution (e.g., distribution varies based on spend level, required response time, etc.) Smart Track can be configured to indicate that, for certain types of requisitions, the distribution list consists of a single vendor.  This typically is applied when sites are predominantly in need of light industrial personnel, and using a Vendor on Premises model within their overall MSP program.  ",4,
Coupa,670,2018,3,1,4,"As indicated above, Smart Track supports a wide range of routing strategies.  Distribution lists and supplier positionings are maintained by specifying within each supplier's profile the skills that they source, locations covered, services to be offered, and placement within the chosen distribution scheme.  These assignments are made by the client using information provided by the supplier in their profile.  The program administrator and other authorized client personnel can modify distribution schemes and supplier positioning without assistance from DCR.

Smart Track can also be configured to include timing for moving to the next tier or phase of distribution. Conditional factors such as  rate, urgency of need, level of response to initial distribution  and other factors can trigger changes to the distribution strategy (e.g., accelerate next wave of distribution, add potential suppliers, etc.)

Within Smart Track, limits can be established for the number of submissions per supplier, or the total number of submissions.  When tiering is used, the hiring manager can, when broadcasting the requisition, refine the list of recipients within the tier based on supplier mark-up or other factors.  

Smart Track lets the suppliers configure the distribution preferences so that the requisitions are routed to the correct recruiter within their organization. Preferences can be based on category and geographical location. ",4,

Coupa,672,2018,3,1,5,"Supplier Performance Assessment: Supplier scorecards can be configured to track up to 25 key client-defined supplier performance measurements. Our clients tend to choose metrics that measure responsiveness to requisitions, candidate and worker quality, policy and regulatory compliance, and rate compliance.  For SOW-based engagements, metrics also focus on timeliness and quality of deliverables. 

Clients can weight each metric, generating an overall supplier score and ranking the supplier against the entire supply base or a selected group of suppliers. At the client’s discretion, separate metrics can be configured and contracted with specialty service firms, small businesses, diversity suppliers or short- term providers of service. Clients can establish thresholds for satisfactory performance at the metric level, or overall. Each supplier's performance can be compared to other suppliers providing similar services in the same locations, or to the overall supply base. Suppliers have access to their supplier scorecards and other reports, enabling them to monitor their performance.

Rates and Rate Changes: When mark-ups and bill rates are negotiated with each suppler, the approved rates are reflected in the rate cards attached to each supplier agreement.  Smart Track pulls that information from the rate card when calculating invoice charges.  Smart Track includes the flexibility to adjust mark-ups for overtime rates, workers reaching FICA/SUTA limits, workers converted to payrolled rates after a specified tenure, and more. 

Smart Track offers complete configuration of rate structures, handling billing complexities which include the following: 
• Capture pay rate, markups, and bill rates.
• Capture rates based on different units such as hourly rates, daily rates and monthly rates.
• Shift-based Rates using either shift differentials or flat rates for each shift.
• Different rates for contractors based on the task (e.g. loading, picking etc.).
• Rate Adders (e.g. equipment allowance, per diem, training markup etc.) based on either flat adder or % markup.
• Rates can be calculated in any currency and then converted through currency exchange capability
• Multiplier (for overtime, double time etc. based on exempt, non-exempt)
• Classification (Payroll, Recruited, SOW etc.)
• Support for location-specific rate composition details

Clients can elect to configure Smart Track to either prohibit entry of amounts that exceed established rates or to require additional levels of approval for the submitted time, expense or milestone payment. 

Rate changes are approved by changing the rate cards and then undergoing an approval process defined by the client.   Once the extension or rate change approval process is completed in Smart Track, contractual changes are updated in the supplier's profile, and – if needed – new documentation can be electronically created and signed.  Any hours that have already been billed automatically go through an adjustment process. A credit/debit memo is automatically generated and the invoice adjustment amounts are automatically calculated. If the hours have already been paid to the supplier, then the adjustment also flows to the Voucher Adjustment process and a credit/debit memo is also created for the payment vouchers.   In addition, Smart Track includes a “mass update” feature that enables mass rate changes, ensuring that in process invoices reflect the rate change where appropriate.

Send and Contractor Volumes: 
Smart Track includes more than 300 standard reports that include  reporting of supplier performance history, filled positions by supplier, supplier rate card compliance, supervisor satisfaction, payment summary, payment received, duplicate pays, and more.

Coupa,678,2018,3,1,5,"Smart Track will rank candidates and consultants based on user-defined required qualifications, preferred qualifications, and desired compensation ranges.  Every requisition entered by a hiring manager includes a skill matrix showing needed skills, the required rating and the years of experience needed. The skill matrix also records whether a skill is mandatory or not. Any applicant responses to custom questionnaires can also be ranked and scored. Each ranking criterion is weighted.

When candidates are submitted, the staffing agency specifies the candidate’s skill level and years of experience against each skill in the skill matrix. The skill match percentage is calculated using this information.  An overall resume rating that factors in both the qualifications and the rate is determined. Side-by-side candidate comparisons can be conducted. All supporting data is available on the candidate presentation page.

If an individual approves the request, it proceeds to the next step in the approval chain.  Approvers may also reject, ask for modifications, or identify additional approvers. 

Smart Track Approval Workflow Management fully supports approvals routed through organizational hierarchy (which can be defined through integration with the client's HCM/HRIS system).  It supports multiple types of hierarchical structures. Our clients use Smart Track to establish hierarchies based on spend limits or organizational structure (e.g. one-up, department based approval, location based approval, VP approval for certain type of projects, specific approvals for certain programs etc.).

Approvals can be queued to a specific user or a group. It does not limit the number of approvers.

Smart Track allows authorized users to revise the approval workflows in real-time by simply altering the graphical workflow depiction.

Coupa,701,2018,3,1,5,"Smart Track enables requisition creation in as little as three clicks of the user's device. The easiest way to create a requisition is to select job titles/descriptions from a catalog, enter the duration of each engagement (or desired start and end date) and create the requisition. Each catalog item specifies the requirements of a particular worker role, classification, and/or location.  This can be done from the user's dashboard or from the requisition page. If the user is not sure of the most appropriate type of non-employee for the role, Smart Track's Engagement Toolkit provides a decision-support system that will guide the user through the decision process.  In the requisition, the requester can indicate the number of resources needed for each location and shift. 

Smart Track can also create a request from global or local templates, prior requisitions, RFx/SOWs or scratch.  Attachments can be included with requisitions as well as additional notes or directions. The requisition page can be specific to reflect the type of worker to be engaged.   Other features of Smart Track to aid in requisition create include the ability to create a requisition using a voice command, and presentation of market-based rates for the required skill and location.

Alternatively, using the Smart Track integration toolkit, requisitions can be created in the client’s eProcurement system and downloaded into Smart Track.  Any change made to the requisition in either system is automatically updated in the other, and Smart Track generates an audit trail of these transactions.  A unique number is assigned to each requisition.  This can be auto-generated by Smart Track or downloaded from the client’s ERP or eProcurement system.  The format of the requisition number can be specified by the client.  The requisition number carries over to the job order and invoice in order to simplify matching of invoices to work orders.",4,

The requisition then contains a code indicating the worker type being sourced and fields reflect the properties/requirements of that worker classification.  Separate workflows and requisition pages exist for contingent workers (internally and externally sourced), SOW-based services, and independent consultants.

Full mobile dashboard capabilities enable approvers to view all time sheets that are awaiting approval and review total spend against budget.  If multiple levels of approval are required, Smart Track workflow ensures that the submitted time and expenses are routed through the approval chain.  Conditional approval chains can be established within Smart Track.  For example, time submission including overtime that was not pre-approved may be routed to an additional level of approval. Also, the approver can route to additional reviewers when questioning a submission. 

To support time and expense approvals, Smart Track checks entries and displays associated messages regarding policies and procedures applicable to the submitter (e.g., eligibility for expense reimbursement, pre-approval requirement for overtime, etc., tenure requirement)  General messages regarding changes in policies or benefits can be displayed for all users.

When reviewing submitted time or expenses, Smart Track automatically displays outstanding budget (expressed in $ or hours) and business rules can prohibit payment if the submission would exceed established budget thresholds.

Approvers can dispute or reject time sheets or activity sheets with remarks.

Different rates or rate uplifts can be established by shift.  Smart Track uses this information to calculate payment for contractors who work different shifts within a pay period.  In addition, Smart Track supports varying work schedules (5x40, 9x80 etc.) as well as capture of hours (daily, weekly etc.).  Client-defined business rules determine the calculation of payments (including premium payments) and deductions when shifts span defined work weeks.",4,
Coupa,711,2018,3,1,5,"Invoices are automatically generated when timecards and expense reports are approved. As soon as the submission is approved, the billable entities are picked by the batch. The rules for cut-off of batches for invoice creation are established by the client and can be configured into Smart Track invoice workflow.  

The statutory costs such as taxes are calculated based on tax calculation rules. Discounts are auto-calculated based on the configuration and any adders such as material, equipment etc. are also included.  Any rules related to rates such as cost-plus fee etc. are applied to the invoice. The taxes can also be configured to be deducted at the source or can be an added in the invoice.  Smart Track can be configured to issue a separate invoice for taxes or include in the main invoice and can display taxes with each line item or as a lump sum amount. 

Once the invoice is created, it is transformed into the appropriate format and is transmitted to the client's payment system. Invoices can be provided electronically via email or through a standard interface. DCR encourages direct integration with the client’s AP systems to reduce effort and errors, and Smart Track has been integrated with virtually all leading ERP/Finance systems.  This can be done via API or flat file.  Once approved in the client’s AP system, the invoice payment details are shown.  Smart Track provides reports on unpaid, outstanding and disputed invoices.

Smart Track is highly flexible; the invoice module can be configured to group the line items by any field (e.g. by PO, by Cost Center, by WBS/Project ID, by Profit Center etc.) so that the invoices can be consolidated based on those fields (e.g. one invoice per Cost Center, one invoice per worker per PO etc.). Consolidated invoices contain line-item details at the resource level, allowing complete visibility into contingent workforce spend. Line item details indicate required payments to each supplier, the MSP, and the VMS provider.  Smart Track can incorporate even the most complicated chart of accounts structure for allocating costs and providing accurate budget allocation and analysis. 

Invoices can be provided in various formats such as Excel, PDF, CSV, HR XML, XML, flat text files and other proprietary formats such as those used by JD Edwards, Peoplesoft, SAP, Oracle Financials, and Great Plains.

Coupa,712,2018,3,1,4,"In Smart Track, when requisitions are created the associated job descriptions indicate onboarding requirements.  These can be specified as “Global” (mandatory to all) or “Specific” (driven by the work location, job title, department, skill, type of service and other parameters), then specific requirements can be further specified as mandatory or desired.

When the worker profile is established, a checklist of onboarding activities is automatically generated within Smart Track, and notifications are automatically sent to those responsible for each onboarding step (the supplier and client personnel).  Actions can include documents to be completed, background checks, drug testing, credit checking, aptitude testing, psychometric testing, written acknowledgement of policies, access and asset provisioning, and training/orientation.  

When each task is completed, the responsible individual updates the status within Smart Track and uploads associated documents that become part of the worker's profile.  Alerts can be issued if the requirement has not been met, and the status will be noted on dashboards for the involved parties. The timing and content of the alerts can be configured based on client preference.

Workers are onboarded by the supplier who serves as the Employer of Record.  To facilitate the completion of required documentation, Smart track can electronically provide documents that can be reviewed and signed via DocuSign within Smart Track.  

Smart Track has extensive compliance capabilities. The system directly links to eVerify for I-9 verification, ensures proper H1-B and G4 Visa status, checks for ACA compliance, has special features to verify that candidates are not on the OFAC or debar lists, and tracks credentials expiry dates.

The Smart Track onboarding module shows the status of background checking and drug testing at a very granular level. For example, in tracking completion of background checks Smart Track monitors receipt of the background check authorization form, background check submission, background check ETA from background check provider (based on county, state and residence changes in last 7 years), background check results, worker notification of results, actions taken to rectify adverse results, and decision made by hiring manager.  All associated documentation is stored in Smart Track.   Reporting of results complies with all relevant privacy laws.

Coupa,713,2018,3,1,4,"To avoid co-employment claims, detailed performance reviews of active contract workers are the sole responsibility of the employer of record (i.e., supplier). However, Smart Track includes a vehicle for contract worker performance feedback to the supplier.  The hiring manager will receive an email requesting feedback.  This can be scheduled in advance, or triggered by the supplier.  The hiring manager will be presented with a list of statements and will respond by selecting the number of stars that indicate the level of agreement with each statement.  This enables the hiring manager to provide feedback on the quality of the service provided without providing feedback that might be deemed as evidence of possible co-employment.

At the end of every assignment, whether completed or terminated prematurely, the hiring manager is asked to complete an online evaluation of the worker and indicate whether the worker should be considered for other future assignments.  If the response is negative or if the contractor have been terminated for performance, the worker is labeled as ‘Do Not Rehire’ and automatically eliminated as a candidate for other jobs.  The reason for this designation can be selected from a drop-down list.  The list includes ""never worked"" as an option to address situations in which candidates accepted the engagement but never reported for work.  The unique ID assigned to the worker stays with the individual across all engagements, enabling the tracking and rejection of these individuals when submitted for any other position within the client's organization. 

Workers are also asked at the end of an engagement to assess their experience.  This information is attached to the worker's profile and available to hiring managers and suppliers. Workers who have successfully completed an engagement are asked to become members of the Smart Track xCHANGE private talent network.  If agreeable, the worker is automatically entered into this talent pool.  Independent consultants, freelancers, former employees, retirees, and interns can  maintain personalized profiles indicating qualifications, credentials, desired positions, expected compensation, recommendations, and availability. The user interface of Smart Track xCHANGE is based on social media standards, making it easy to build a profile.  In fact, individuals can import their LinkedIn or Facebook profiles.  The individual can also upload supporting documentation.

Requisitions will be created within Smart Track. The VMS makes it easy to create a requisition for agency contractors, freelancers and contract services project teams. Of course, Smart Track can also establish [MSP NAME] as a delegate to your hiring managers in order to create requisitions on your behalf if needed. 
Smart Track allows requisition creation in as little as three clicks of the user's device. The easiest way to create a requisition is to select items from a catalog, enter the duration of each engagement (or desired start and end date) and create the requisition. Each catalog item specifies the requirements of a particular worker role, classification, and/or location. This can be done from the user's dashboard or from the requisition page. If the user is not sure of the most appropriate type of non-employee for the role, Smart Track's Engagement Toolkit provides a decision-support system that will guide the user through the decision process. In the requisition, the requester can indicate the number of resources needed for each location and shift. 
Smart Track can also create a request from global or local templates, prior requisitions, RFx/SOWs or scratch. Attachments can be included with requisitions.

In terms of requisition distribution:
Smart Track supports a wide range of requisition distribution strategies, including sole source, a tiered broadcast, round robin process, all-inclusive broadcast and metrics-based broadcast. The VMS also supports a hybrid of these supplier management processes based on parameters such as department, organization, job category etc. Timing for distribution between layers can be configured, and tied to a particular skill type, location, business unit or other factor. Smart Track lets the suppliers configure the distribution preferences so that the requisitions are routed to the correct recruiter. Preferences can be based on category and geographical location.

These price structures can be tied to different suppliers who are fulfilling the SOW and different business units, work locations, programs etc.

When creating a requisition, projects are comprised of work packets, each of which can be either T&M or milestone based. Milestone-based work packages specify the work to be performed, deliverables and timing of milestones, vendors, budget, individuals authorized to sign off on each milestone, etc.  For T&M, the system uses catalogs of job descriptions with associated pay rates.  

Within Smart Track the response format is defined through user-specified pricing and non-pricing questions with extensive question formats such as check-boxes, radio buttons, upload of documents etc. Smart Track also specifies documents to be attached (FAR regulations, NDA, etc.).
