It allows customers to capture extensive non-financial & financial information about requisitions, candidates, contingent workers  their engagements, SOW based projects and suppliers. Transactions like timesheet, expenses, invoices, payments capture extensive data points for the product & its users to make informed decisions.

In addition, it creates a history (date and time stamp, user conducting transaction) of every record's original creation and update; every transaction's submission, change and approval; every interface to external applications (e.g. validation of charge# with ERP systems, submission of invoice, update of organization hierarchy etc.), every mass update (file upload or call of import/export API), and every report creation (including the users and parameters used for the report).  Audit trails of all transactions are viewable as logs and/or reports.

We have full backups on a daily basis during off-hours.  In addition, we also conduct differential backups every hour and a transaction log backup every 30 minutes.  All upgrades and patches also require a full backup prior to applying the patches. The data is stored onsite and then moved offsite at the end of every month. The full and incremental backups are retained for 3 months. Thereafter, only the full backups are retained for another 6 months and then the backup is stored and archived in AWS glacier for long term access and audit.  CCW uses Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) as the cloud backup storage provider.

Transactional data is archived every quarter if it is older than 7 years. However, for reporting, the data warehouse always contains the data and it is not purged.

Because the needs and priorities of each client differs, a formal process is employed to establish SLAs.  It includes the definition of the key performance indicators, the stakeholder/audience being impacted, and the goals/thresholds to be measured.  Metrics are then entered into CCW during initial configuration.  CCW can monitor, analyze and report on any KPI. Most clients elect to include delivery metrics, stakeholder satisfaction measures, compliance measurements to ensure adherence to corporate policies and government regulations, and product performance SLAs that measure CCW availability, hotline responsiveness, and resolution of technical issues.

CCW includes predefined CWM KPIs related to submittal rate, submit-to-interview ratio, submit-to-hire ratio, time to submit, time to fill, diversity, attrition, cost metrics, billing accuracy, and user satisfaction. For SOW-based contract services, predefined metrics that have been found very effective include accuracy in tracking all approvals, change order management, tracking resources against task orders, billing hours by resources against different task orders, expense reporting, and tracking deliverables and invoicing based on different milestones, and tracking of funding allocated to PO/Task order.  In addition, SOW KPIs typically include compliance with onboarding for all resources working on SOW projects, time to fulfill task orders by suppliers, and burn chart tracking for projects.

 
Supplier Scorecard Reports included within CCW can be configured to track up to 25 key client-defined supplier performance measurements.  Clients can weight each metric, generating an overall supplier score and ranking the supplier against the entire supply base or a selected group of suppliers. At the client’s discretion, separate metrics can be configured and contracted with specialty service firms, small businesses, diversity suppliers or short-term providers of service. Clients can establish thresholds for satisfactory performance at the metric level, or overall. Suppliers have access to their supplier scorecards and other reports, enabling them to monitor their performance.

 
CCW, tracks and reports on all established SLAs.  Every transaction is tracked.  CCW provides analytics with the backup detail to monitor and measure the program performance. CCW will also pull data from the enterprise applications that it has been integrated with to provide comprehensive data analysis.  All analytics can be based on different parameters such as service categories, location, business units etc.

Service Level Agreements and KPIs need to evolve with the program to meet the dynamic needs of the enterprise. Planned changes to processes, projects or goals for the upcoming quarter are reviewed, and an assessment of whether the KPIs are effective in helping to measure performance against stated goals is periodically conducted.

AWS offers Coupa a redundant SAS70/SSAE16 certified infrastructure and ensures complete reliability, scalability and security along with multiple availability zones in different regions. For security purposes, Coupa and Amazon do not reveal the locations of these data centers.  AWS offers enhanced security tools and features:
•        VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): All assets are hosted within VPC and can be only accessed via a secure VPN tunnel. VPC traffic goes through single internet gateway.
•        Subnets: VPC is further broken down in high available Subnets access to which can be controlled via ACL rules for both inbound and outbound traffic.
•        EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute): All assets (including webservers) have private IP addresses and are contained within Security groups (Software firewall)
•        Elastic Load Balancer: External service that has rotating IP address and allows users to connect only via HTTPS URL.
•        S3 Bucket: high durable, scalable and secure object bucket that allows us to encrypt store objects such as backups and static content.

Intrusion detection sensors report events to a central security management system. CCW is a role-based system, with user access controlled by role and through password management.  Data is encrypted in transit and sensitive data is also encrypted at rest.  We use symmetric encryption based on AES-256 algorithm. Keys are configured separately for each client. The backups and static objects are stored in S3 in an encrypted format using AES-256. We use Amazon EBS encryption to encrypt EBS volumes attached to EC2 instance (server).  Data in motion is also encrypted. PGP/RSA is used to encrypt the files during staging and transfer. CCW uses SSL certificate and all the information submitted by the user is encrypted using AES 256 bit encryption using TLS 1.2.  IIS application pool identify is used for the application to connect and authenticate against the database.  PII data is not used or stored by CCW unless requested by the client.  CCW automatically scans all files prior to upload, and quarantines, cleanses, and blocks specific file types using up to date malware signatures at the application layer.

Our data centers are housed in nondescript facilities. Physical access is strictly controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional security staff utilizing video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means. Authorized staff must pass two‐factor authentication a minimum of two times to access data center floors. All visitors and contractors are required to present identification and are signed in and continually escorted by authorized staff.

7,47,2019,3,1,5,"Coupa encourages clients to integrate CCW with their internal ERP, Financial and HCM/HRIS systems. CCW's integration toolkit includes pre-built Connectors to leading industry time tracking, HRIS and ERP systems.  

CCW fully supports data exchange (upload and download data transfer) via flat text files and APIs. For flat text files, it supports both delimiter and fixed width formats.  For file transfer to directories using SFTP, the generation is in the form of CSV with delimiters defined in the toolkit (e.g. pipe, comma etc.) and text qualifiers using quotes. The files are encrypted using PGP over RSA.

The API connections include mass uploads through API, use of web services (REST API, XML/SOAP) as well as SFTP and HTTPS protocols. CCW’s published REST-based APIs expose both product objects as well as actions for integrations. CCW also supports Batch-based ETL.  In addition, CCW also uses the Publisher-Subscriber (Pub-Sub) pattern for integrations which lets the external systems handle their own schedule of publishing or reading the data. 

On average, CCW is integrated with five internal systems for each client.  More than 40 integrations have been established for one client.  The APIs are typically related to:
• Master data administration: CCW has APIs which allow master data to be administered using web services. The APIs allow the CRUD operations and the audit trail is tracked for the master data updates.
• SOW Project-based API: The SOW Project-based APIs let projects be defined in external systems and the APIs transfer the project data to CCW. The contracts, SLAs and tracking can be done in any external system and transferred to CCW.
• Workforce Management: All onboarding, off-boarding and worker changes are available as services.
• Invoice & Payment: The invoices and payments are exposed as REST API.
• Organization Hierarchy and Financial Hierarchy: The organization and financial hierarchy can be updated within CCW through the services.
• Callback API for Calendar: CCW offers calendar API to be called by Google calendar and Office 365 calendar so that changes in the user’s own calendar are visible within CCW.

The CCW integration toolkit is a standard component of the product. No additional fees are required for integration. Integrations are fully tested when initially established and during every new feature release.  ",3
7,48,2019,3,1,5,"CCW has ""out of the box"" integrations with eVerify, First Advantage, Office 365, OFAR and debar listings, and other systems critical to verifying candidate credentials and eligibility and system ease of use.",3
7,49,2019,3,1,5," CCW is a highly configurable system, seldom requiring customization that involves software coding.  If required, most customizations are tied to integration with client's internal systems.

Customizations undergo the same development process as is used for new functionality.  Research and documentation is thoroughly completed for each item. A complex defining process is initiated for each item after which a design document is generated and reviewed with a control team. The all-encompassing principles followed in this process are acquired from ITIL techniques.  

To verify that any custom modification are not affected when new features are released, all system changes undergo a Change Management Process which include communication, training, change management collateral and acceptance testing. ",3

7,60,2019,3,1,5,"CCW offers comprehensive analytics capabilities that go beyond operational reporting. Our capabilities will identify gaps where clients can reduce costs, improve operations and increase visibility in the following areas: 
• Rate benchmarking – Rate cards can be configured to be pay rate cards, or markups. When entering a new requirement, CCW uses external benchmark data to show competitive pay ranges for that assignment based on role and location.  Market rate info is gathered from 'crawlers 'that review open websites and original research into contingent labor supply/demand.  The Client’s job titles are mapped to a standard job title and the locations are mapped to a MSA (Metro Statistical Area). Using this information, CCW’s spider software finds these positions and associated rates. N-dimensional analyses are then conducted to establish and compare rates by category, supplier, organization, division, department, or service. Rate/cost/fair market and rate variance analyses are also conducted. Benchmarking is done for pay and bill rates as well as mark-ups.  When a requisition is created, CCW automatically shows market rates for that job title and location.
• Cycle time benchmarking – Process cycle times are baselined during the first three months of the engagement, and performance metrics are established for each area needing improvement by considering industry benchmarks and the client’s desired levels of performance. CCW automatically measures cycle times and process times for every step in each process at every location for both supplier and internal processes. Actual process times and cycle times are benchmarked against the lowest and average times. Results are available through standard process time analysis reports which typically are issued and reviewed monthly. 
• SOW project analysis – Reports relevant to project burn rates, SLA tracking and operational deliverables are available. 
• Metrics-based reports – trending, scoring and ranking based on different performance metrics. Reports merge aggregate client statistics with general market data for benchmarking purposes. 
• “What if” scenarios – spend forecasting, resource mix analysis, and bill rate adjustment analysis. 
• Comparative business intelligence reports – comparisons between periods such as quarter to quarter change or same quarter year over year change. CCW queries can be saved, enabling clients to create snapshots of data at a given time, with anytime access, to report and analyze trends over time. 
• Active requirements analysis – CCW delivers analytical data to be used in weekly requirements reviews. This consolidated data includes analyses of candidate match, candidate status, bill and pay rate submissions ranges, and related data that identifies potential areas requiring attention.

7,669,2019,3,1,5,"CCW supports a wide range of requisition distribution strategies, including sole source, a tiered broadcast, round robin process, all-inclusive broadcast and metrics-based broadcast. CCW also supports a hybrid of these supplier management processes based on parameters such as department, organization, job category or other factors specified by the client. In addition, client-specified conditions can determine supplier distribution (e.g., distribution varies based on spend level, required response time, etc.) CCW can be configured to indicate that, for certain types of requisitions, the distribution list consists of a single vendor.  This typically is applied when sites are predominantly in need of light industrial personnel, and using a Vendor on Premises model within their overall MSP program.  ",4
7,670,2019,3,1,5,"CCW supports a wide range of routing strategies.  Distribution lists and supplier positionings are maintained by specifying within each supplier's profile the skills that they source, locations covered, services to be offered, and placement within the chosen distribution scheme.  These assignments are made by the client using information provided by the supplier in their profile.  The program administrator and other authorized client personnel can modify distribution schemes and supplier positioning without assistance from Coupa via front end configuration functionality.
CCW can also be configured to include timing for moving to the next tier or phase of distribution. Conditional factors such as rate, urgency of need, level of response to initial distribution  and other factors can trigger changes to the distribution strategy (e.g., accelerate next wave of distribution, add potential suppliers, etc.)

Within CCW, limits can be established for the number of submissions per supplier, or the total number of submissions.  When tiering is used, the hiring manager can, when broadcasting the requisition, refine the list of recipients within the tier based on supplier mark-up or other factors.  

CCW allows suppliers to configure the distribution preferences so that the requisitions are routed to the correct recruiter within their organization. Preferences can be based on category and geographical location. ",4

7,672,2019,3,1,5,"Supplier Performance Assessment: Supplier scorecards can be configured to track up to 25 key client-defined supplier performance measurements. Our clients tend to choose metrics that measure responsiveness to requisitions, candidate and worker quality, policy and regulatory compliance, and rate compliance.  For SOW-based engagements, metrics also focus on timeliness and quality of deliverables. 

Clients can weight each metric, generating an overall supplier score and ranking the supplier against the entire supply base or a selected group of suppliers. At the client’s discretion, separate metrics can be configured and contracted with specialty service firms, small businesses, diversity suppliers or short- term providers of service. Clients can establish thresholds for satisfactory performance at the metric level, or overall. Each supplier's performance can be compared to other suppliers providing similar services in the same locations, or to the overall supply base. Suppliers have access to their supplier scorecards and other reports, enabling them to monitor their performance.

Rates and Rate Changes: When mark-ups and bill rates are negotiated with each suppler, the approved rates are reflected in the rate cards attached to each supplier agreement.  CCW pulls that information from the rate card when calculating invoice charges.  CCW includes the flexibility to adjust mark-ups for overtime rates, workers reaching FICA/SUTA limits, workers converted to payrolled rates after a specified tenure, and more. 

CCW offers complete configuration of rate structures, handling billing complexities which include the following: 
• Capture pay rate, markups, and bill rates.
• Capture rates based on different units such as hourly rates, daily rates and monthly rates.
• Shift-based Rates using either shift differentials or flat rates for each shift.
• Different rates for contractors based on the task (e.g. loading, picking etc.).
• Rate Adders (e.g. equipment allowance, per diem, training markup etc.) based on either flat adder or % markup.
• Rates can be calculated in any currency and then converted through currency exchange capability
• Multiplier (for overtime, double time etc. based on exempt, non-exempt)
• Classification (Payroll, Recruited, SOW etc.)
• Support for location-specific rate composition details

Clients can elect to configure CCW to either prohibit entry of amounts that exceed established rates or to require additional levels of approval for the submitted time, expense or milestone payment. 

Rate changes are approved by changing the rate cards and then undergoing an approval process defined by the client.   Once the extension or rate change approval process is completed in CCW, contractual changes are updated in the supplier's profile, and – if needed – new documentation can be electronically created and signed.  Any hours that have already been billed automatically go through an adjustment process. A credit/debit memo is automatically generated and the invoice adjustment amounts are automatically calculated. If the hours have already been paid to the supplier, then the adjustment also flows to the Voucher Adjustment process and a credit/debit memo is also created for the payment vouchers.   In addition, CCW includes a “mass update” feature that enables mass rate changes, ensuring that in process invoices reflect the rate change where appropriate.

Send and Contractor Volumes: 
CCW includes more than 300 standard reports that include  reporting of supplier performance history, filled positions by supplier, supplier rate card compliance, supervisor satisfaction, payment summary, payment received, duplicate pays, and more.

This is used in managing pre-identified vendors for SOW-based projects as well as internally sourced candidates who will be payrolled under the program. Conditional-based approval workflows can be configured for all pre-identified requisitions at both the requisition and candidate level, checking for justification for using a pre-identified resource and candidate attributes such as ex-employees and retirees.",4
7,676,2019,3,1,5,"CCW is a role-based, business policy driven solution.  When establishing roles and associated permissions, the program administrator can indicate that certain roles or individuals are authorized to change standard distribution lists. Business rules specify the conditions under which these changes can be made, and approval workflows can be tied to each of these conditions. For example, when tiering is used, the hiring manager can, when broadcasting the requisition, refine the list of recipients within the tier based on supplier mark-up or other factors.  This can automatically trigger an additional approval workflow.  

CCW reports on modifications to distribution lists by hiring manager, supplier, requisition type, location, business unit, etc.  This enables to program administrator to easily spot non-conformance trends.

7,678,2019,3,1,5,"CCW will rank candidates and consultants based on user-defined required qualifications, preferred qualifications, and desired compensation ranges.  Every requisition entered by a hiring manager includes a skill matrix showing needed skills, the required rating and the years of experience needed. The skill matrix also records whether a skill is mandatory or not. Any applicant responses to custom questionnaires can also be ranked and scored. Each ranking criterion is weighted.

When candidates are submitted, the staffing agency specifies the candidate’s skill level and years of experience against each skill in the skill matrix. The skill match percentage is calculated using this information.  An overall resume rating that factors in both the qualifications and the rate is determined. Side-by-side candidate comparisons can be conducted. All supporting data is available on the candidate presentation page.

Specific features include:

•        Use of Artificial Intelligence.  CCW Match Index Intelligence uses AI-based natural language processing and machine learning to determine the match of candidates' resumes to requirements and then compare and bucket the candidates. This is not a standard keyword search but an AI-based algorithm which does contextual analysis.  It also is used to gather data over time regarding hiring manager selection preferences and then factor this information into the scoring of each potential candidate (for example, the system might recognize that individuals with a degree from a particular university tend to be hired more frequently than other candidates). 
•        Rapid response.  Our real-time candidate-matching and recommendations are based on an in-memory database, which gives real-time processing speed. 
•        Anonymous submissions. CCW detects supplier information in resumes without having to open the resume, warning the Program Administrator of embedded supplier information such as supplier logo, phone number, supplier name etc. CCW can also detect ""white fonting"" and other techniques aimed at unfairly manipulating candidate evaluation algorithms.
•        Compensation ranges.  CCW supports the inclusion of rate card lower and upper limits within each requirement. The lower limit aids in ensuring that candidates have the prerequisite levels of skill and experience. 
•        Automated feedback. When evaluating submitted candidates, CCW enables the reviewer to select a reason for rejecting the candidate, or to request additional information on the candidate.  This triggers a notification to the supplier.",4

If so, hiring managers have the ability to review the candidate’s profile and all associated documents and request individual or group interviews as well as additional screening steps.  Dates and times can be specified, as well as whether the interview must be in person, by phone or by Skype. Multi-phase interviews can be scheduled and conducted. CCW is fully integrated with Office 365 and other calendar systems, enhancing scheduling and coordination. CCW notifies the MSP or program administrator and the supplier via email as well as with items in the user's To-Do List.  Post-interview, CCW captures standard information regarding the interview date, time and attendees, overall assessment, recommended next steps and general comments.

In addition, resumes and other documents are scanned for identifying supplier information that might bias the hiring manager toward/away from a particular candidate.  There is no limit to the number of attachments, and CCW imposes a restriction of 3MB max per resume file, although the client can change it, if desired.  CCW allows candidates to be presented in multiple formats based on worker type and client preference.

When former workers (ex-employees, ex-contractors) are submitted as candidates, prior work history with the client is displayed on the candidate presentation page.  This includes position, dates of engagement, supervisor, performance assessment(s), and compensation.

CCW also supports conditional selection as follows:
- Candidates can be selected with a flag of ""Backup Only"" while issuing an offer. This lets the supplier complete all the compliance requirements (e.g. drug test, background check etc.) so that the candidate is ""onboard ready"" and if any of the preferred candidates fail to onboard, the candidate is marked ""cleared to start"".

Required credentials and associated rankings vary by job title and job description.  They can also vary by business unit, location, hiring manager, or other client-specified factors.

CCW Match Index Intelligence uses AI-based natural language processing and machine learning to determine the match of candidates' resumes to requirements and then compare and bucket the candidates. This is not a standard keyword search but an AI based algorithm which does contextual analysis.  It also is used to gather data over time regarding hiring manager selection preferences and then factor this information into the scoring of each potential candidate (for example, the system might recognize that individuals with a degree from a particular university tend to be hired more frequently than other candidates).

Access can be granted to the user as well as the role. 
•        CCW enables the user to view the status of all transactions, including requisition approval, distribution, supplier submissions, candidates screened, interviews conducted, candidates selected/rejected, onboarding activities, time card submissions/approvals, assignment extensions, and offboarding.  CCW also indicates status of certifications and licenses requiring renewal.  Each module includes a ‘list view’ showing status.  By clicking on the ""heartbeat"" symbol, the manager can see a graphic depiction of where they are in the workflow, and what the next steps will be.  Also, CCW's list views allow ad hoc sorting and filtering as well as search on all standard and custom fields. The text fields are searchable with ""contains"" clause. The standard fields are searchable with drop down/type ahead searches. 
•        Users are notified of any actions they need to take via email and posts to their dashboard To Do lists.  By clicking on any item in the To Do list the user goes directly to the specific record and can perform the needed transaction.
•        CCW offers more than 300 standard reports. Standard reports are available for all modules, and allow the users complete visibility into all fields, activity and history. Filters can be applied to transaction types, locations, or any other type of filter that provides views of different levels of activity from the enterprise to the individual. Every field in CCW, including custom fields, are reportable.  During implementation Coupa will extract reports from CCW, determine their alignment with the client’s reporting requirements, and make any needed adjustments and additions to provide a basic set of standard reports that meet all needs. We will also work the client to determine preferences regarding report access, rights to create ad hoc reports, distribution frequency and format of each standard report. CCW will be configured to reflect these preferences.  The client will be able to generate standard and ad hoc reports without assistance from Coupa or their internal IT staff.
•        Highly configurable, role-specific dashboards give clients and suppliers a graphical and interactive investigation of their workforce data.  All actions can be directly taken from the dashboard.
•        CCW creates a history (date and time stamp) of every record's original creation and update; every transaction's submission, change and approval; every interface to external applications (e.g. validation of charge# with ERP systems, submission of invoice, update of organization hierarchy etc.), every mass update (file upload or call of import/export API), and every report creation (including the users and parameters used for the report).

CCW Approval Workflow Management fully supports approvals routed through organizational hierarchy (which can be defined through integration with the client's HCM/HRIS system).  It supports multiple types of hierarchical structures. Our clients use CCW to establish hierarchies based on spend limits or organizational structure (e.g. one-up, department based approval, location based approval, VP approval for certain type of projects, specific approvals for certain programs etc.).

Approvals can be queued to a specific user or a group. It does not limit the number of approvers.

If the user is not sure of the most appropriate type of non-employee for the role, CCW's Engagement Toolkit provides a decision-support system that will guide the user through the decision process.  In the requisition, the requester can indicate the number of resources needed for each location and shift. 

CCW can also create a request from global or local templates, prior requisitions, SOWs or scratch.  Attachments can be included with requisitions as well as additional notes or directions. The requisition page can be specific to reflect the type of worker to be engaged.   Other features of CCW to aid in requisition create include the ability to create a requisition using a voice command, and presentation of market-based rates for the required skill and location.

Alternatively, using the CCW integration toolkit, requisitions can be created in the client’s eProcurement system and downloaded into CCW.  Any change made to the requisition in either system is automatically updated in the other, and CCW generates an audit trail of these transactions.  A unique number is assigned to each requisition.

Invoices can be provided electronically via email or through a standard interface. CCW encourages direct integration with the client’s AP systems to reduce effort and errors, and CCW has been integrated with virtually all leading ERP/Finance systems.  This can be done via API or flat file.  Once approved in the client’s AP system, the invoice payment details are shown.  CCW provides reports on unpaid, outstanding and disputed invoices.

CCW is highly flexible; the invoice module can be configured to group the line items by any field (e.g. by PO, by Cost Center, by WBS/Project ID, by Profit Center etc.) so that the invoices can be consolidated based on those fields (e.g. one invoice per Cost Center, one invoice per worker per PO etc.). Consolidated invoices contain line-item details at the resource level, allowing complete visibility into contingent workforce spend. Line item details indicate required payments to each supplier, the MSP, and the VMS provider.  CCW can incorporate even the most complicated chart of accounts structure for allocating costs and providing accurate budget allocation and analysis. 

Invoices can be provided in various formats such as Excel, PDF, CSV, HR XML, XML, flat text files and other proprietary formats such as those used by JD Edwards, PeopleSoft, SAP, Oracle Financials, and Great Plains.

CCW can be configured to create invoices in local currency, with roll-ups at the enterprise level in the currency chosen by the client.",4
7,712,2019,3,1,5,"In CCW, when requisitions are created the associated job descriptions indicate onboarding requirements.  These can be specified as “Global” (mandatory to all) or “Specific” (driven by the work location, job title, department, skill, type of service and other parameters), then specific requirements can be further specified as mandatory or desired.

When the worker profile is established, a checklist of onboarding activities is automatically generated within CCW, and notifications are automatically sent to those responsible for each onboarding step (the supplier and client personnel).  Actions can include documents to be completed, background checks, drug testing, credit checking, aptitude testing, psychometric testing, written acknowledgement of policies, access and asset provisioning, and training/orientation.  

When each task is completed, the responsible individual updates the status within CCW and uploads associated documents that become part of the worker's profile.  Alerts can be issued if the requirement has not been met, and the status will be noted on dashboards for the involved parties. The timing and content of the alerts can be configured based on client preference.

Workers are onboarded by the supplier who serves as the Employer of Record.  To facilitate the completion of required documentation, CCW can electronically provide documents that can be reviewed and signed via DocuSign within CCW.  

The CCW onboarding module shows the status of background checking and drug testing at a very granular level. For example, in tracking completion of background checks CCW monitors receipt of the background check authorization form, background check submission, background check ETA from background check provider (based on county, state and residence changes in last 7 years), background check results, worker notification of results, actions taken to rectify adverse results, and decision made by hiring manager.  All associated documentation is stored in CCW.   Reporting of results complies with all relevant privacy laws.

CCW is integrated with First Advantage (formerly Lexis-Nexis). The integration is based on their First Advantage XCHANGE API. The system can be integrated with other Background Check providers based on their API and the client’s business requirements.   ",3
7,713,2019,3,1,5,"To avoid co-employment claims, detailed performance reviews of active contract workers are the sole responsibility of the employer of record (i.e., supplier). However, CCW includes a vehicle for contract worker performance feedback to the supplier.  The hiring manager will receive an email requesting feedback.  This can be scheduled in advance, or triggered by the supplier.  The hiring manager will be presented with a list of statements and will respond by selecting the number of stars that indicate the level of agreement with each statement.  This enables the hiring manager to provide feedback on the quality of the service provided without providing feedback that might be deemed as evidence of possible co-employment. The questions are front-end configurable and developed by your organization to ensure internal compliance with company policies.

At the end of every assignment, whether completed or terminated prematurely, the hiring manager is asked to complete an online evaluation of the worker and indicate whether the worker should be considered for other future assignments.  If the response is negative or if the contractor have been terminated for performance, the worker is labeled as ‘Do Not Rehire’ and automatically eliminated as a candidate for other jobs.  The reason for this designation can be selected from a drop-down list.  The list includes ""never worked"" as an option to address situations in which candidates accepted the engagement but never reported for work.  The unique ID assigned to the worker stays with the individual across all engagements, enabling the tracking and rejection of these individuals when submitted for any other position within the client's organization. 

Workers are also asked at the end of an engagement to assess their experience.  This information is attached to the worker's profile and available to hiring managers and suppliers. ",3

Depending on the agreement established with each supplier, a rate card may be established on a per project/ work packet basis with a supplier, or a single rate card can apply to all engagements with that supplier, or a common rate card can be established for the work packet/project that is applied to all suppliers.",4
7,850,2019,3,1,4,"When a supplier indicates in CCW that a milestone is complete, an alert is automatically issued to all approvers.  The approvers review the evidence of completion, and - if the deliverable is deemed to be incomplete or unacceptable - the approver can request send comments requesting changes or asking for more information, can make a partial payment, or can reject the request.  If the deliverable is rejected, the approver is asked to provide a reason using a drop-down list and text box.  This information is send to the supplier.",3
7,851,2019,3,1,4," Using their mobile or desktop device, temporary workers and consultants can easily enter and modify hours worked. Alerts notify managers of the availability of this time sensitive data and they can immediately review and approve time card submissions. Full mobile dashboard capabilities enable approvers to view all time sheets that are awaiting approval and review total spend against budget. Supervising managers will be able when approving hours to view actuals vs. budgets for each worker and alerts are sent to supervising managers and their approval chain when budget thresholds are approaching.  CCW’s time-keeping module generates warnings related to potential end dates, funding availability, abuse and approval deadlines.

Invoices are automatically generated when timecards or expense reports are approved.  Invoices can be formatted to meet client needs, with roll-ups at the department, group, facility, enterprise or other level.  

Approval of milestones can also drive T&M payment requests. Business rules can trigger workflows in which approval of deliverables or achievement of milestones automatically send notifications to designated personnel requesting T&M approval.",4
7,852,2019,3,1,5,"In addition to T&M and milestone payments, CCW supports lump sum at the end of the project (for smaller SOW); duration-based; percentage of completion or hybrids of these. it also supports expense reimbursements. These price structures can be tied to different suppliers who are fulfilling the SOW and different business units, work locations, programs, etc.

For duration-based payments, CCW is configured to indicate frequency of payment.  At each interval, approver(s) are notified via text, email and dashboard posts.  In addition, the remaining budget is displayed along with and rules regarding payment.  The approver can approve, reject, or authorize partial payment.  The approver can also ask for more information or enter comments.  CCW notifies the supplier of the action taken, and updates the status list.

Percentage completion payments are made in a similar way, except the supplier triggers the action by indicating that the percentage agreed to in the SOW has been completed.

The CCW expense management module distributes and communicates expense management policies to workers, defines spending limits, configures rules based on department or user type, triggers alerts and notifications indicating potential non-compliance, and provides variance and deviations reporting. 

Workers document their expenses in CCW Expense Module, including the expense type, upload of receipts, supporting documents etc. Expenses can be entered from a mobile or desktop device, and the CCW mobile app uses the camera for uploading receipts for expense reporting so that images clicked by the camera can be directly used in the expense report. Company-specific expense policies are configured in the system to prevent violations and track and flag any deviations from the travel policy.  Workers can track the status of submitted expense reports.  All transactions are audited, and reports enable authorized users to monitor expenses.

Expenses can be submitted in different currencies, and local tax laws can be applied.  Reporting can be in multiple currencies, or consolidated into enterprise-level reports in a single currency.",4
7,853,2019,3,1,5,"The terms and conditions in the SOW indicate whether interim payments are allowable.  If so, the SOW also indicates the rules for such payments (amounts, % of total, timing, conditions for release, etc.) and this information is configured within  CCW.  When interim payment requests are made, the approver is automatically notified; then reviews the request, outstanding budget, and rationale for an outstanding payment and makes a determination.  

As indicated in response to the question regarding deliverables-based payments, the approver can fail to approve the deliverable but decide to make an interim payment.  The reason for doing so must be included.  This information is then available via notification and dashboard post to the supplier.",3
7,854,2019,3,1,4,"The invoice module can be configured to group the line items by any field (e.g. by PO, by Cost Center, by Project ID, by Profit Center etc.) so that the invoices can be consolidated based on those fields (e.g. one invoice per supplier, one invoice per payee per PO etc.). Consolidated invoices contain line-item details at the resource level, allowing complete visibility into services procurement spend.",3
7,855,2019,3,1,4,"Within CCW, the supplier merely enters time worked or checks a box indicating that a deliverable has been completed.  For periodic payments, the supplier does not need to take action to request payment.

An invoice is automatically generated when a milestone, T&M time submission, expense report, periodic payment or interim payment is approved.  The supplier does not have to submit an invoice.   ",3
7,856,2019,3,1,4,"The process of reconciliation of billing to the cost allocation starts at the requisition when the default allocation is defined. When suppliers are confirmed against the requisition, cost allocations (e.g. cost center, GL etc.) are defined for the supplier. The payment request is always against the cost allocation (multiple accounting strings can be charged in a given time sheet). The invoice detail is to the line item level of the cost allocation.

Every transaction is automatically tied to the project and work packet IDs, also enabling reconciliation.

There are multiple reports which provide detailed reconciliation against the client’s GL system. Some of the reports are:
- Accrual Reports
- Invoice Detail Report
- Daily Spend by Charge#
- Billing Reconciliation Report",3
7,857,2019,3,1,4,"Suppliers are notified by CCW of rejected time or expense entries, or deliverables payment requests.  Clients can allow suppliers can respond via CCW or can require that the supplier contact the designated client representative directly.  CCW offers complete transparency into all transactions through list views and audit trails.  Lists and reports typically used to address billing disputes include:
•	Rate validation per contract
•	Time card validation per time card for the week submitted
•	Milestone rejection justifications
•	Any time and/or rate adjustment that may have been processed
CCW also provides an easy interface for adjustment that allows for corrections to any time card or invoice within a defined look back period specified by the client. It can be configured to indicate adjustment authorizations and required approvals. The system can automatically notify specified personnel via email, text and/or posts to the users' dashboards.  The system captures each transaction (date, time, nature of change, individual making the adjustment) and detailed reporting provides audit trails of all transactions.   An important feature of CCW is that the approver can also do a line-item rejection of a timecard or expense report, approving the remainder while the disputed hours or expenses are addressed.",3
7,858,2019,3,1,5,"CCW associates all project-related data with a unique project code tied to sub-codes for individual tasks/milestones. In addition, each supplier is assigned a unique identifier that remains constant across all engagements.  When charges are authorized, an invoice is created.  CCW can consolidate invoices by supplier.",3

If the deliverable is rejected, the approver is asked to provide a reason using a drop-down list and text box.  This information is send to the supplier.

CCW can also track performance against SLAs or other special conditions and calculate associated invoice adjustments. If a penalty is assigned to an SLA (e.g., completion of a milestone by a particular date) and the  supplier fails to meet the SLA, the payment will automatically be reduced by a previously-agreed upon amount or percentage.",3

Discounts are auto-calculated based on the configuration and any adders such as material, equipment etc. are also included.  Any rules related to rates such as cost-plus fee etc. are applied to the invoice. The taxes can also be configured to be deducted at the source or can be an added in the invoice.  CCW can be configured to issue a separate invoice for taxes or include in the main invoice and can display taxes with each line item or as a lump sum amount.",3
7,861,2019,3,1,5,"CCW is designed to address charging to multiple cost centers.  Cost centers, project codes and task codes are established in the requisition, then automatically carried forward.  They can be uploaded into CCW through integration with the client's ERP and/or PMM systems. A supplier can split time across cost centers, with appropriate rates applied to each.  CCW can accommodate different approvers for each cost center.  When charge codes are updated within the integrated ERP or PMM system, CCW is also automatically updated.",3
7,862,2019,3,1,4,CCW can track capital expenses on a non-billable basis. This can be done directly or through integration with the client's PMM system.,2

7,866,2019,3,1,4,"The estimated budget against a requisition is calculated or entered at the time of requisition creation and finalized when a SOW project is confirmed. Each contract may have multi-level budgets addressing different program elements. When payments are requested, comparisons are made to budget.  Authorized users are notified and alerted as the spend amount approaches specified percentages of the budgeted amount.  CCW forecasts the date or hours left on a budget based on past burn rates.  Client-defined business rules also specify timeframes in which expenditures can be charged to a specific cost center or budget. 

If requests exceed available budgets, actions can be tied to the budget (e.g. reject or require additional approval). User-specific dashboards and Budget Analysis Reports provide real-time status of spend against a budget at the project level or for work packet.

Authorized project managers can update projects, rolling back unused budgets to the project level or reallocating to other task orders.",4
7,874,2019,3,1,4,"CCW includes the ability to report on all data captured in the system, providing complete visibility at the individual, department, and location level.  CCW includes more than 300 standard reports, and can report on any established SLA metric, and any field.  During implementation, the client’s preferred reports and desired formats are loaded into their instance of CCW.  Custom versions of each of these reports can be created reflecting and field/data contained in CCW. For any standard report, the user can apply filters to determine the scope of the report, timeframe covered, export format, timing of generation, and other factors.  Reports can also be sent/received by email. Reports may be scheduled to be delivered via email, desktop or mobile device on a pre-defined schedule.

RESTful web services (this is our preferred method)
See “Elevated SaaS application Web Services - Resources for Corporate HR” as example of current functionality.

File transfers (SFTP/FTPS)
We transfer files to the server via some method and then have server processes that extract and process the information.  File formats for this are usually CSV or XLS/XLSX. We have a lot of experience parsing such files and it can be very flexible.

DB staging tables
We have the data loaded into staging tables in the database and then have a server process that watches those tables and then does something with the information.

Like Excel you can input multiple sheets with differnt formats and formulas.  Sheets can be repviewed and the formulas tested.

For a simple example, a user couldn't plug in a date for a project if it was out of alignment with other dates within the project.  If you look at the new RFQ selector screen, when a user chooses an RFQ type it changes the functions the see on the left.  That way the user is prevented from making errors.

66,2214,2019,3,1,5,"As related to sourcing, we eat what we cook every day. When we help people drive implemention we analyze current processes, current templates, create project plans, and KPIs, and help them achieve their goals. Our team members are highly trained sourcing advisors so we talk procurement not IT. This is a main differentiator for K2 Sourcing.  If they just want training then we provide mutiple training sessions with built in homework, we adivse the leaders to dictate or set incentives, and we montior system usage, and follow-up with leaders.  1 on 1 meetings are provided with an advisor to help with template creation. Clients can have an advisor check any set-up anytime and get feedback at no charge.  Every 6 weeks we allow users to have another 1 on 1 with an advisor to check system features ask questions and set-up more templates.  Ongoing dependent on customer openness we have feedback and continous improvement meetings to help direct system and service level improvements.  We provide tempaltes to notify suppliers, and provide full support for onboarding, creating commodity taxonomies, project planning etc.

Masters in business. Expert in project management and with a 2nd degree in psychology a master at change management.  I still handle the 1st round training direct because I want to hear and see the systems from a fresh set of eyes. New users ask the best questions. Our 2nd trainer is Tina and who does all the follow-up meetings and event set up quality reviews and provide support to the clients on a daily basis. She also has a Masters degree in business and 10 years and procurement experience. All those years have been with K2 Sourcing and she is run over 800 events on behalf of clients. She is a certified CPSM and project manager. Because we are only focused on a sourcing solution and it is typically not integrated it is really a educational and change management implementation. 
",2.5
66,2216,2019,3,1,5,"We have companies that outsource their entire strategic sourcing process to K2 Sourcing. We will review spend, risk profile management, category strategy, sourcing and executing sourcing strategies, implementation, cost savings and value tracking, etc. We have a very defined repeatable process that is documented. Every Monday my team meets to improve review our processes and our technology to drive continuous improvement. Very few teams have been doing this for 16 years.

",2.5
66,2217,2019,3,1,3,"To identify opportunities we typically have to classify spend. We can classify at the supplier level to start with and then typically move into the transactional data using keyword fuzzy match tools. Because we work with a lot of midmarket and smaller companies we can usually do this in Excel, and can apply past categorization that we have done. With data enrichment that is typically going to be needed on the indirect cateogries.  This is done on a case by case basis as projects are needed.  Ususally it is a combination of working with the suppliers to obtain the needed data and some combination of manual look-ups.  At the end the goal is to get cleansed data so suppliers can provide quotations.  In many of these instances as we review supplier recrods we are aslo looking at vendor master set-up and trying to remove duplicate reocrds,maximize terms, etc.  In other biggers instances, we will partner with a spend analysis Corporation like SpendHQ, Roslyn, or Simfoni to classify first.  These are resale/referral solutions and are non-integrated.",2

66,2219,2019,3,1,5,"Again because we eat what we cook every day and we have such well-defined processes, we offer services to help our customers.  When we help people drive implemention we analyze current processes, current templates, create project plans, and KPIs, and help them achieve their goals. For instance, Academy Sports originally had us run almost all their events for 2 years, while working with an internal point person. That built the process and all the templates. Once built we transition that to their team who hired a couple people and started the process internally.  If they want to start by self-running events we will make sure each users first events are successful.  This is a main differentiator for K2 Sourcing.

We provide tempaltes to notify suppliers, and provide full support for onboarding, creating commosity taxonomies, project planning etc.  We provide monthly training webinars at no cost, provide unlimited support at no cost - which sometimes falls in advising more than support.  Our system has compete user manuals, videos for most functions, and FAQ's which are being converted to a bot.  ",4
66,2220,2019,3,1,5,"See above. Every customer is assigned an advisor. They can directly email or call their advisor any time. These advisors have run typically hundreds of RFPs and reverse auctions and have access to our complete library of templates. To give you an example a client called with a question about an LTL event. The client hadn't run such an event for their stakeholder. Our advisor looked at the template and show them a couple errors where they would need different data from their stakeholder and show them how they would load this template into our application for advanced pricing. Our client went back to their stakeholder and received kudos for catching the error and being able to execute effectively. Our job is to make our clients successful period and we do what it takes.  Upgrade training is handled through webinars and updates to user manuals and user videos.  This is free of charge.  Regarding maintence we proactively reach out every 6 weeks for one on one sessions with users.  We also provide monthly free webinars that cover system features or explain templates.

However category management typically would mean going beyond to day-to-day management and supplier performance which we don't do. Transportation and indirect spend our particular strengths. We are also very good at direct materials domestically. A lot of this is covered in our earlier responses to services, we have team members that have run over a thousand events, we use a specific 30 step process and 200 point checklist that is been revised and improved for 15 years. We report funnel and actual and realized savings and drawn a large network of fellow experts that we network with. Definitely differentiated capability.

66,2236,2019,3,1,1,We know our clients enough that we share specific articles that could impact them. We know what suppliers they've awarded to in the past so if we hear something we will certainly pass it on.

For instance, say they are not sure of the level of competition in the market they can run an RFQ on hundreds of items and instantaneously, if the initial results look great, flip all the suppliers quotes at the item level into a reverse. This is just one instance as the tools extremely flexible to support sourcing strategies.

So it's easy for newer buyers or even an existing manager to come in and say all of this hasn't been run for a while or this was a unique way of doing it. So the system is very good at maintaining knowledge capital.",1

Later the embed again to TradeShift will allow access to supplier markets and a ton of other applications that can plug in like project management or workflow or business intelligence etc. That platform is what TradeShift is selling. Improved award of business,stakeholder collaboration, and multilingual are at the top of our list.",2
66,2251,2019,3,1,3,"We have defined extremely complex models in our software. For instance, we move beyond total cost in 1 of our models to look at impact on the balance sheet of an organization calculating things like leadtime and necessary inventories, pushing this all back to the P&L to create best value assessments. Should cost is not hard.",3

66,2253,2019,3,1,3,Even within a BOM you can create subgroups to invite multiple suppliers that only receive the information they need related to that piece. It will subtotal each component and help with supplier analysis.,2.5
66,2254,2019,3,1,2,The buyer creates the cost models and loads information to them. As suppliers upload actual costs which through formulas can be extended through volumes it becomes pretty clear with the different factors are. You can also compare one supplier to the next so it's not just the cost factor comparing cost factors across suppliers.,1.5
66,2255,2019,3,1,4,"We provide template packs based on what the customer desires. Clients can also call us anytime for additional templates or to help us help them build their own templates. We talk about logical groupings from the start of implementation and the tool allows them to change these categorizations with the categorizations flowing through. So for instance if the plan is run transportation RFPs we can provide an entire set of RFPs and cost models and carriers for the client to use. So the solution is customized. We built in a community forum, but found our customers felt limited about what they wanted to share.",3
66,2256,2019,3,1,1,Users can upload any type of demand information they want into the application. This is typically done via Excel.,1
66,2257,2019,3,1,4,"If a user can create the should cost model and Excel they will have no problems doing it in our application. Our application even when changing headers is built to feel very similar to Excel not like a database. Formulas can be a applied across all items on tables very very quickly so it makes it very easy to work with large groups of data. When combined with our service, if they need help with some should cost models, we can help them build it they will have to go get the base data. This typically falls under free support. If they have the base data you can run an anlysis of each supplier against each component or the total of the ""should cost."" ",3
66,2258,2019,3,1,2,Our system uses predefined workflows based on the templates chosen. So if a user would use a reverse auction its going to use a different flow than a simple quote. The user can somewhat modify the process because they can change any of the dates and run an RFI before an RFQ or flip an RFQ to a reverse auction or take a piece of an RFP and create approval rules for suppliers.,2
66,2259,2019,3,1,3,"RFx can be created from the collection of templates. To combine multiple templates is pretty straight forward, download the template in Excel combine them and upload them.

The models are agreed to through advisory practices. We are mostly using these for transportation right now so these are pretty well-known models from both my side and Bid Mode.

66,2269,2019,3,1,2,"The tool is used frequently for direct materials and specifically for a bom with multiple categories you don't have to use the lot function but we would typically recommend it. When you load your items into the database you can establish different lots. By establishing different lots it makes it easier to invite suppliers just to the category they need to quote and then they will only see those prints. So it makes it much easier for the supplier. Yes you could import this directly from the ERP as long as you added the lots. However, one could assign everything to a single lot and just load all the items to get totals and subtotals.",2

66,2271,2019,3,1,4,"Yes. You can create analytics based on current cost against replacing exact match with substitutes and comparing it on a supplier by supplier basis etc. We run a lot of indirect and MRO events where this is pretty critical. The system can also allow for unit of measure conversions to get more accurate comparisons of substitutes. Unique to our application you can also add as many columns hidden from suppliers as you want, which allows you to do all kinds of cool analysis and switching costs from the incumbent, should cost, standard cost, benchmark cost etc. If you can imagine it you can create the model and make for fast award decisions.  ",4
66,2272,2019,3,1,2,Suppliers are categorized by commodity so by default it will pull the suppliers that are not disqualified for that category.,2

66,2275,2019,3,1,4,Bidding is completely definable based on the parameters the buyer expresses. These can include any type of formulas and any type of information requested.,3
66,2276,2019,3,1,4,"You can copy whole bids so that you can compare or alternatively with even faster is to flip between different bid types. For instance, it's common to start with a blind bid to fix errors and gage competition. When all looks well to finalize negotiation flip it into a reverse auction. We have been told in demos we are extremely flexible.",3
66,2277,2019,3,1,4,This is again completely controlled by the buyer and how they set up the template. You could get 20 different offers and have them all bounced against the standard and benchmark and against each other and against the other suppliers if you're so inclined.  ,4
66,2278,2019,3,1,3,"For spot buys or recurring market (like monthly buys) you can put together a simple quote and copy from it and get it out to as many suppliers as you want in under 5 minutes. We have some plans that will take this to the best in class, but need to complete some other stuff 1st.  ",3
66,2279,2019,3,1,2.5,The system will rank each item in a matrix so you can easily see count of ones and twos. The system also calculates savings automatically and the bid so you can quickly gauge the supplier's performance and shortlist to get to a smaller and analytics pool.,2.5

66,2283,2019,3,1,4,"Yes these are standard features being able to very easily pause and allow bid corrections based on specific sections or groups/lots of items and only to given suppliers. Users have complete control and do not need to contact technical support. It is part of standard training. Additionally, if it is a reverse and the system will automatically extend the overall and time by the amount of time the bid has been paused. I should mention the way we train our clients and run events caused events are fairly rare. We train people to use a pre-bid process or flip from an RFQ to make sure there are no errors up front. Because her application ties item level data to aggregate you then come up with a very accurate high-quality event which rarely needs a pause or if it does it's a very short pause to correct a keying error.  ",3
66,2284,2019,3,1,4,"The system does not automatically highlight the changes by the suppliers, and in some of the bid types it will replace previous offers at the item level rather than keep the full history. Other bid types you can keep the item level data even if it's a thousand items. The system does tabulate an aggregate offer at all times and keeps track of each iteration. Users can always download the initial reports and save them for future reference. We did just show a template whereby you can even analyze the ""negotiated save"" from the 1st quote to the revised quotes for each supplier automatically.",4
66,2285,2019,3,1,0,These are currently manually done except in the case of reverse auctions which aren't really round base right they're open market.,0
66,2286,2019,3,1,2,"It takes just a few clicks to change an RFQ into a reverse auction. You will just need to follow the workflow to fill in additional information like bid increments, extensions, ceilings, etc.",2
66,2287,2019,3,1,3,"Any event can be copied or you can simply reopen it which is what many people do. Make the latest volume changes, swap out a few items, change baselines, even redo formulas, and reopen. This would normally only take a few minutes. One can also simply add new columns to have additional data added at any time so you could do this for years and you can only do it on certain items of the whole thing.  ",3
66,2288,2019,3,1,4,"I do see AI taking over the ability to handle automatic data and outlier correction, as well as negotiate.  Integrated to big data and supplier performance from large networks, and aligned with the right questions to ask in 10 years I have to think souricng will be pretty much done by AI with humans double checking results.  That is our vision/rodamap.",3
66,2289,2019,3,1,1,The demand for other auction types is fairly low.  We have designs for all auction types as they would just be configurations of the reverse auctions or forward auction so we might just go ahead and do it at some point. We are not seeing high demand for these types.,1
66,2290,2019,3,1,4,"In addition to all the features mentioned in column F, we have a couple special things that help suppliers.  Many auctions can't handle a high number of SKUs or items. So they bid at the lot level only. The issue is on the backend you get poor reports and you will find out it is very difficult to implement the savings – they disappear. So we have tools that allow suppliers to download and upload their actual quotes during live reverse auctions. 2nd we have tools that will automatically apply weighted percentages across all the items so they can quickly quote. We have tools that allow them to put in a minimum the buyer never sees so much like the proxy when they use the fast bidding technology, it prevents errors and allows them to be better prepared rather than using off-line spreadsheets.",4
66,2291,2019,3,1,2,"The buyer would have the option to either simply restart an event, restart an event but allow some basic corrections and changes to parameters like ceiling values, or copy from a previous event start over.",2
66,2292,2019,3,1,2,"All information can be pulled across, but we limit the number of fields allowed in reverse auctions simply for speed of the event when you have many many items. Go 5G.",2.5
66,2293,2019,3,1,3,"Once the reverse and begins the buyer has complete control with no need for technical support. They can change times, change extensions, bid increments, pause or request live bid corrections they can allow different bidders to submit, they can disqualify bidders, they can change weights, they could even add new suppliers. The only piece we don't have here is automatic pause if bidders drop or don't show up.",3
66,2294,2019,3,1,4,Any proxy bidding is controlled completely by the suppliers. The suppliers choose who other bidders in the organization are. Buyers are not given control of this. They are given all or nothing access to the event so we'll let the suppliers use their own internal policy and hierarchies to get right. What sets us apart is the ability to establish minimums with the weighted average automatic application so that the entire team is on the same page.,4
66,2295,2019,3,1,2,"We are strong proponents of teaching people to use a very good pre-bid process whether that is through the pre-bid tool or running an RFQ and then flipping it to a reverse. Our tool also has automated training. Basically what I'm stating as if there is a need for a lot of messaging during a reverse auction the client was not trained to properly run a reverse auction. All the details should be worked out or you won't get the best results.
",2
66,2296,2019,3,1,1.5,"Suppliers control how to switch to proxy, and are really responsible for managing their login. We can certainly see everything on the buyer side.",1.5
66,2297,2019,3,1,1,"The system allows for a burden factor to be applied to different suppliers based on a precalculated model.
",1
66,2298,2019,3,1,3,Each supplier is categorized by its commodity and industry and buyers have categories as well. So when they go to invite it automatically selects that group of suppliers. At the same time it won't show suppliers that have been previously disqualified.,3
66,2299,2019,3,1,2,Adding some of the more automated error detection and optimization would be key areas for improvement.,2
66,2300,2019,3,1,1,We are using home-grown algorithm to develop problem solutions,1
66,2301,2019,3,1,4,"In addition, the system uses intelligence to understand the difference between a null value and a no quote. In other systems the supplier has to define every cell which usually causes them to click a lot and complain in any type of event that has more than several items. Our system suppliers can just leave items null or blank and the system will ask them a couple questions to apply a rule to the entire bid, which then ensures the math is correct on the buyer side. In the Spend Matters file I share a cost of capital model which moves beyond total cost to total value. That being said it is pretty straightforward to program more complex models like injection molding where you would have resin, scrap, resin cost, cycle times, machine rates for cost, operator cost, pieces per hour, etc. to really drill down into a suppliers details. I didn't have any in the in our actual demo set up, and ran out of time but would be happy to demo this for the analyst.",4

66,2304,2019,3,1,2,It will set up items and subtotals based on how the user initially sets up the system. It really depends on how events are set up. It will always display by lot and item and supplier so really you can use different combinations and scenarios to allow different comparisons very quickly. We always train users to start with the end in mind.,2

Templates include all major transportation types including truckload, less than truckload, ocean full container, ocean less than container, air, intermodal, specialty, etc. We didn't have time to prepare the full demo for this but would like to show the analyst.",3
66,2318,2019,3,1,4,Yes and some of the models get extremely complex. When you start talking about less than container load you can get different rates for weights as well so these line cards get pretty long. Many of our templates allow you to both quote the rate card as well as huge groups of sample lanes – Brady entered 3000 so that the carriers apply their rate card to the sample lanes which we can then compare against real historically invoiced rates. This is a best practice. Many times when you bid Intermodal you also look at full truckload to determine the best advantage versus leadtime. So this is looking at multiple modes at the same time. ,3
66,2319,2019,3,1,0,Companies are specifically using this to establish contract rates through some type of RFP process.,0

66,2321,2019,3,1,3,Templates are available that look at leadtimes to calculate inventory carrying costs. We just ran an optimization scenario where the company was sending out items for plating to 1/3 party they would come back to the manufacturer and then they would ship to the Texas manufacturers location. Out of the manufacturer is pooled at a low cost into full truckload. We looked at LTL shipping direct from the supplier and moving the quality function to their Texas location.

69,10,2019,3,1,4,Our user interface is transaction based so as soon as the transaction occurs you can refresh and see the new data on the dashboards. We can alos build custom dashboards in our business intelligence environment. The data is near real time between the application and the reporting environment with about a 2 min delay of when data is entered and then replicated in the reporting environment. These reports can be scheduled to be delivered as well so users are getting their user specific dashboard to their inbox.,4

If the vendor does not exist a vendor org is created for that vendor. Vendors can be added in an active, inactive, or pending status",3
69,669,2019,3,1,5,Clients can define the type of tiers they want to add their vendors into. Most utilize tiers based on performance but some use tiers for other criteria like diversity and funding types. Clients can determine which vendors are associated to each tier. They can also determine which locations and positions each vendors has access to.,3
69,670,2019,3,1,5,We can define multiple different ways to route requisitions to the supplier community. You can limit which poistions the supplier can receive as well as which locations they have access to. We also support tiering of the vendors so that depending on the tier assigned to the vendor you can route the requisitions accordingly.,3
69,671,2019,3,1,4,To add new vendors into the application our team vets the vendor and assures that they do not already have a profile created with a new customer. If no profile exists today then they are added into the supplier network and provided an org. Vendors will have access in one org to all the customers they service. If a customer would like to remove a vendor from their program they can make them inactive in the self-service admin portal so that the vendor no longer recieves requisitions from the client. The vendor profile can be updated at any time by the client and vendor details can be updated by the vendor themselves.,3
69,672,2019,3,1,5,"Using our reporting environment our customers can easily see metrics around their suppliers. We have two standard reports today that are utilized by the majority of our clients to review the performance of the supplier. These reports provide analytics around the vendor responsiveness, candidate & engagement quality, rate analysis, percentage of spend, volume measures, and more. All reports can be configured as well so we do have many customers that we have created tailored analytics for to measure vendor performance.

These fields are reportable so metrics can be kept on how frequently participation is declined on requisitions,3
69,675,2019,3,1,4,You do have the ability to denote on the requisition if a candidate is pre-defined.

Those who can see the unscreened candidates have the ability to review the candidate before they are distributed to the hiring manager creating a shortlist of only qualified candidates. We do generate composite scores to compare the skills defined on the requisition to the skills of the submitted candidate.

Here they can leave their own rankings of the candidates using the ""My Star"" functionality. If the user needs more information regarding the candidate their is a request that can be sent through the system to the vendor. Every candidate also has a reference section where questions and comments can be made to the vendor and the vendor can respond on the candidate record.

On the candidate record you can view the details of the candidate including but not limited to the: candidate name, email, phone number, SSN, and any custom fields that need to be captured. You can also see the skill set of the candidate, the compliance attached and completed for that candidate, their employment history with the client, their rate information, and any other reference comments or attachments. This information can be configured based on what information the client wants to see.",3
69,684,2019,3,1,4,When a vendor submits a candidate it is up to the client whether they want all users to be notified of the new candidate or just the MSP. The MSP can recieve the candidates first and screen the candidates record and resume before allowing the hiring manager to see the candidate. Everything in the system is time and date stamped so you can see when the candidate and their resume has been submitted. ,3
69,685,2019,3,1,4,A budget can be generated when creating a new requisition. This budget can go through an approval process if desired. If the budget needs to be updated this can be done and it will go back through the approval workflow to ensure that the newly adjusted budget is approved by the correct users. Budget can be adjusted and proved after engagement as well.,3

In the system today if there is an item that will impact the budget associated to that engagement (rate, end date, cost center, etc) the users can determine if they would like to enable engagement change approvals. This way budget impacting changes will have to go through an approval process before they go into effect. The system is time and date stamped so that if changes do occur to the engagement a engagment change history record is created and can be viewed at any time to review engagement changes.",3
69,687,2019,3,1,4,"If there needsw to be an update to the hiring manager or the staffing supplier your admin users will be able to change the hiring manager or vendor associated to the requisition or the engagement depending on what status the worker is in. The current assignment does not have to be terminated it can be transitioned for the hiring manager, a new engagement record would have to be created to update the vendor. With this update an approval process can kick off to approve the transition of the resource to another vendor.",3

69,691,2019,3,1,5,The whole system is role and permission based so that users can only see the requistions/engagements that they have access to. While an admin user may see all reqs/engts in the application a hiring manager may only see the reqs/engts they were added as a contact on.  Reports can be created to report on reqs/engts and similar to the web application the reporting is based on what the user can view as well. Reporting users can either have access to all the data in the system or just the data that they are affiliated to. The whole system is time and date stamp so all creation and editing of records is kept in a transaction history log that can be reported on. ,3
69,692,2019,3,1,5,Each user can have an alternate user for when they are absent or not available. The proxy can be added or removed as needed and can perform approval and review functions on the behlaf of the hiring manager. The MSP can also have alternate users attached to their profile. Each engagement can have as many alternate time/expense approvers as desired and they can be added or removed as needed.,4
69,692,2019,3,2,,,4
69,693,2019,3,1,4,When submitting the candidate the vendor can add the resume to the candidate profile. Resumes can be downloaded from the application for review. Skill information can also be tracked on the user record and compared side by side with other candidates that have been submitted.,3
69,694,2019,3,1,5,"Yes, onboarding requirement can be configured to meet the requirements of both the position and location.",3
69,695,2019,3,1,5,The system can track all timecards to see what timesheets are outstanding regardless of the status of the worker.,3
69,696,2019,3,1,5,If all required fields have not been entered into the application whent trying to submit an item a error notice will trigger and highlight the items on the page that need to be completed for a page submission to occur properly.,3
69,697,2019,3,1,4,As users are going through the application they will see a workflow to indicate where they are in the process. Fields that are required are highlighted. If the incorrect format is applied for a field a tool tip will appear to let the user know what type of corrections they need to make. We have searchable help available for all parts of the application. Users can also use the Guide Me functionality to point them to the correct locations in the tool for the tasks they are trying to complete.,4
69,698,2019,3,1,4,"There are clear messages that appear for the user to indicate why a page cannot be submitted, a report did not run, an appointment can be made, etc.",3
69,699,2019,3,1,5,New rates can be entered on the engagement record with the appropriate effective date. This can be done on the individual record or we can run a script to update multiple rates across a population of contractors. If there is a rate change the client can determine if they want to kick of an additional approval process to approve the new rate. Once a rate has been approved it will be applied as the new rate and the old rate will be tracked in our engagement history panel to track when the rate was changed and by whom. Even if a rate is rejected the proposed rate will be tracked in the history section.,4
69,700,2019,3,1,4,Approval routing is configured during implementation to reflect the business rules of the organization. We can keep an integration running with the changes to the organization and the resulting approval hierarchy. Exception approvals can be noted in the system and be on a req by req basis. The req status is communicated to the designated users by the client and will trigger any time there is a status change to the requisition. Alerts will also be sent to appropriate approvers to approve the requisition and any other reviewing user.,3
69,701,2019,3,1,5,Temp staffing requisitions can be done a variety of different ways. We have some organizations that utilize our templating funtionality to build out all their requisitions and reduce their overall clicks. Other organizations prefer to fill out all the req fields each time they enter a requisition. VectorVMS also has the ability to copy a requisition so that once a manager builds a req out they way they can prefer they can just copy the same req informaiton into a new requisition for the next position they hire. We can also integrate requisitions into our application to pull data in from a third party ERP system. ,3
69,702,2019,3,1,5,"When designing a clients workflow we build their req templates and levels based on how they would like to drive their requisition creation. We have some clients that drive reqs by the type, others by location, some prefer to go by department. This is completely configurable based on the clients needs.",3
69,703,2019,3,1,4,"We have a variety of different statuses our clients can use to denote the status of the requisition. A requisition can be put on hold, cancelled/closed, or if you need to update the requisition it can be moved back into pending status until the changes have been approved.",3
69,704,2019,3,1,3,Managers can come into the application and search on the requisition name they would like to complete. Managers can also look at the past requisitions that they have created an copy those requisitions when sourcing for a new position.,2
69,705,2019,3,1,4,Our application tracks both time and expense within the applicaiton. Depending on the needs of the customer time can either be submitted through our time keeping system or imported into the application from a third party time keeping system. The whole system can be rendered on a mobile device so that the contractor can enter time on a remote device.,3
69,706,2019,3,1,4,"The system can recognize the approver for the timesheet or expense and directly route an approval notification to that users inbox. From the users inbox they can approve the time for that contractor. Within the application the user will have the ability to review individual time cards or approve timesheets in bulk. On the timecard you have the ability to see the time against many projects, cost centers, GL codes. Time can also be applied across varying billing rules (overtime, on-call, shifte, etc.). If a manager needs to dispute a timesheet they can reject a timesheet and provide comments to the vendor who will be notified of the update on the timesheet.",3
69,707,2019,3,1,5,Proxy approvers are allowed to enter time on behalf of the contractor if the contractor is not able to enter this time. This could be the vendor or the client if needed. Alternate time entry users need to be denoted on the engagement record,3
69,708,2019,3,1,5,If a timesheet is unapproved a notification can be sent out to designated users that time is outstanding. VectorVMS also has an out of the box report that will denote all missing timesheets in the application and what weeks they are missing for each contractor.,3
69,709,2019,3,1,4,There are timesheet summaries in both the client and the vendor applications that allows the users to view the timesheets in each status. Users can see all timesheets and their statuses or filter on the timesheets based on status.,3
69,710,2019,3,1,4,Using our robust billing rules our clients have the ability to configure multiple different shifts for one worker and time can be applied to different shifts in the same day,3
69,711,2019,3,1,5,We run a job to pull all approved time out of the application at whatever frequency defined by the customer that generates an extract of all approved time. This extract can either be downloaded out of the system or sent over SFTP to the ERP system used by the client/partner to complete the consolidated invoice and payment on behalf of the client. We can also feed approved time into another timekeeping system if this is what is being used as a system of record for time. ,3
69,712,2019,3,1,5,"Our robust compliance manager allows clients to track their specific onboarding, offboarding, position, and location specific compliance. Within each item that is tracked you can determine what is required for it to be complete, when it is due by, and if a response attachment is required. We have many clients who use this to track licenses and verifications to ensure that if an item is due to expire the correct users are notified. On/off boarding contacts can be denoted in the system to complete specified compliance items. No information is ever deleted out of the system so the compliance manager can be used as a record for any audit that comes up later on down the line.",4
69,713,2019,3,1,5,VectorVMS supports evaluations for the engagements. This can be configured to ask any questions about the contractor to provide feedback. This will stay with the worker and can be viewed by any user with access to the record. Evaulations can be done at the frequency desired by the client and notices can be sent out to users to remind them to complete the evaluations for the worker.,3
69,721,2019,3,1,5,"VectorVMS has 120 standard reports that report on items specific to temp staffing contractors and those that are more wide spread across the organization. For example, we have head count reports, tenure tracking, rate analysis, role tracking for the temp staffing contractors. We also have non-temp staffing contractor centric reports that report on time-to-fill, vendor quality, spend tracking, fill rates, and early terminations.",5
69,721,2019,3,2,,,5
69,724,2019,3,1,5,We have a variety of pre-built standard reports for our users based on their role. Our system also allows users to modify existing dashboards to make them more specialized or create new dashboards if desired.,4
69,729,2019,3,1,5,"VectorVMS has a variety of spend based reports to give you analysis on what you are spending and in what forms (time, expenense, invoices, etc). These reports can be sliced and diced to meet different break out requirements. These reports can break out temp staffing performance in regards to rates, KPIs, responsiveness, and more.",4
69,729,2019,3,2,,,4
69,789,2019,3,1,5,Yes we have a separate SOW module that can draw on the configuration of the temp staffing module. There are variations in the configuraiton of the SOW but the same resources will be needed for both modules.,3
69,790,2019,3,1,3,"You can be associated to the SOW at any time. A user can create the requisition and associate contacts at the creation or add them at any point in the process. This could be at req creation, proposal review, contract creation, or any time during the duration of the contract. This allows users to enter the contracting process at any point desired.",3
69,791,2019,3,1,3,All aspects of VectorVMS can be accessed through a mobile device allowing users to complete any part of the workflow through a mobile device.,2
69,792,2019,3,1,4,Suppliers can be designated as SOW suppliers only so that they only receive bids from the SOW module. If a new supplier would like to register for access to the SOW module they can reach out to the program manager to request access. Once a request is made to add the vendor access can be provisioned to the technology to respond to bids.,3
69,793,2019,3,1,3,SOW vendors can be added into the vendor section of the application and you can require the submittal of specific documentation associated to that vendor.,3
69,794,2019,3,1,5,Yes you can track any type of documentation and other types of requirements for the supplier on the SOW and in the vendor portal. You can track items like expiration dates and waiver requirements as well.,3
69,795,2019,3,1,5,"You can tier vendors however you see fit a variety of different ways. The first is to limit their access to the requisition types (SOW, Temp Staffing, etc) that you would like them to have as well as by location. In addition you can tier your vendors based on priority or status that can be adjusted at any time. ",3
69,796,2019,3,1,5,"When creating the SOW you have the ability to determine if you as the client want to define the SOW, have the vendor define the SOW, or collaboration between the two entities. All revisions can be tracked in the tool. There is reference sections in the SOW and the proposal that negotiation can be done through as well.",2
69,797,2019,3,1,4,Within the application a vendor can have subvendors that submit candidates on their behalf which will roll up the spend under the master vendor.,3
69,798,2019,3,1,5,Suppliers will have their own portal that they can log into to submit candidates and proposals into the system. Every workflow for the vendor is clearly marked so they know their progress as they are going through the workflow. Attachments can uploaded on records as well as the suppliers dashboard. Reporting can be delivered to the supplier to their inbox.,3
69,799,2019,3,1,4,SOWs can be created in the system by going through the service requisition creation workflow. ,3
69,800,2019,3,1,5,"Yes our system can integrate with all major ERP systems today. VectorVMS has a standard methodology for setting up integrations between systems. We do our integrations through SFTP. Sample integrations we do are AP systems, PO integrations, finance code integrations, background checks, requisition import/export, active directory, and more. ",3
69,801,2019,3,1,4,We have a questionnaire section of the application that allows you to generate a series of questions for the vendors to complete with their proposal submittal. These can be added on a SOW by SOW basis. You can make multiple different questionairres to have available depending on the service requisition type.,2
69,802,2019,3,1,4,"Suppliers do have to be vetted and registered to recieve the requisition through the application. If the client would like an integration to post the SOW to other sources this is an option as well. Suppliers can be associated as SOW suppliers, they can be tiered based off of performance, limited to specific suppliers, or suppliers can be excluded off of a requisition for any reason you see fit.",3
69,803,2019,3,1,5,The supplier will have their own portal to log into to view all of the details of the service requisition. If they feel they meet the requirements they can submit a proposal back to the client with their responses. You can determine how you want to distribute to your SOW vendors whether that is a blanket send or through tiers. New suppliers can be added at any time to requisitions if you would like to provide them with the opportunity to participate. You can decline or accept participation in the sourcing process.,3
69,804,2019,3,1,5,"You can assign contacts to different roles in the SOW process whether that is the client contract, the client req owner, the client reports to user. You can add contracts on the vendor side as well. MSPs can be added as contacts on the requisition or granted access to all of the SOWs.",3
69,805,2019,3,1,5,"When the supplier recieves the list of deliverables and questions from the client they have to submit a proposal back into our system with their acknowledgment, acceptance, or revision of the deliverables. They will have to complete any required questionnaires associated to the requisition. They will also have the ability to add comments or attachments to the proposal to be reviewed by the client.",3
69,806,2019,3,1,5,"Yes you can determine if you would like to use milestones, resources (time & material), fees, or any combination of the three. As fields are added in each category they become required for the suppliers review and acceptance. If you would like the vendor to define the scope of the project that is also an option and they can build the scope with the payment types above.",3
69,807,2019,3,1,4,"Yes, vendors can submit multiple responses to a single SOW. This is across the application.",3
69,808,2019,3,1,4,If a supplier requires more information about the requisition there is an area in the reference section of the requisition to request more information. These keeps all communication in the application and it is all time and date stamped for record. If the SOW needs to be amended this is possible but it may require additional approval depending on client configuration. Changes to the SOW will be supplier wide changes and will be visible to all suppliers.,3
69,809,2019,3,1,3,There is not a Q&A designated section but the reference section can be used to communicate between supplier and client.,1
69,810,2019,3,1,2,While there is the ability to post a questionnaire out their for the supplier to respond to the tool does not calculate scoring based on the answers that were supplied. You can leave a review of the proposal but that would be the users own rating not a system generated rating of the proposal.,1
69,811,2019,3,1,4,Users can leave reviews on proposals so that other users can look at their reviews and record their own. When reviewing a proposal users can leave comments and scores. You will be able to see aggregate scores and all comments around the proposal.,3
69,812,2019,3,1,4,As you are reviewing proposals reviews can be made about the proposal and can be viewed against the vendor. You can reject a proposal if it does not meet requirements. Proposals can be dispositioned as you go to down select or remove supplier proposals from the service requisition.,3
69,813,2019,3,1,4,During the review process the client can communicate to the vendors using the reference section on the requisition. The vendor can use the same section to communicate with the client. Anytime there is an update to the SOW a notification can be sent out to the supplier population and all deliverables will be accepted by the vendor. ,2
69,814,2019,3,1,4,All of the proposals will be located and housed against the original requisition for easy access. If a supplier has multiple responses you will be able to see these responses in the same area of the application. Negotiations can be done against each of the submitted proposals and proposals can be reviewed against each other as needed.,3
69,815,2019,3,1,4,"You can create different options when selecting an SOW to create in VectorVMS and assign vendors to them accordingly. When creating the requisition you have to complete each of the pages to accurately reflect what you would like to see in the way of deliverables. Distribution, contact information, and approval workflow will automatically default. ",3
69,816,2019,3,1,1,This is not a functionality that we have today. If you have the RFx we can use that to create the SOW but there is not an RFx feature of the technology that will generate an SOW.,1
69,817,2019,3,1,3,You can create different requisition classes and levels for service requisitions within the application. This will allow you to segment the SOW by the correct category. If a requisition requires a different type of approval you can manually select the approver needed,3
69,818,2019,3,1,5,"When creating an SOW it can either be created by the client, vendor, or both. In creating the SOW the client can communicate with the vendor and vice versa to build out the SOW to satisfy both parties. This can include entering or updating milestones, communicating regarding resources, change fee amount and types. It is highly configurable for collaboration across the vendor and client users.",3
69,819,2019,3,1,2,Today there can only be a master SOW we do not support child SOWs to be included in a project. You can add additional resources or line items to reflect other projects but you cannot tie other SOWs in the system to each other. We can have multiple cost centers or projects on a single requisition that payment types can be added to but there is not a separate workflow that can be designed using the financial codes as a deliniator between projects.,1
69,820,2019,3,1,3,When creating a deliverable you can indicate the date at which payment is due and on the resources you can have timesheets entered with the date worked. The payment terms are driven by the payment terms on the vendor page of the admin portal. Only the terms on those pages driven from the MSA will be utilized when looking at billing and invoicing. ,2
69,821,2019,3,1,5,Project IDs or work order numbers can either be manually keyed into the system or imported from the clients financial system. The user can determine which project ids or work order numbers should be included on the service requisition. Multiple can be selected.,3
69,822,2019,3,1,1,There is not e-signature capabilities today with our SOW module.,1
69,836,2019,3,1,3,"When a SOW is created the users will be able to accept, revise, or reject individual items. This will be tracked in the application and changes will be tracked for historical purposes as well. You can upload and download SOWs from the system for review however you have to complete redlining outside of the application.",2
69,837,2019,3,1,5,"Using a combination of milestones, resources, and or fees users have a variety of different ways to track pricing and payment in the application. Milestones will have amounts attached to them that can be paid partially or in full. Resources can be tracked with different type of billing logistics depending on the contractor (regular time, over time, on-call, shift, etc). Payment can be associated to multiple different projects, cost center, and GL Codes. If using fees the fees can either be fixed or variable. ",3
69,838,2019,3,1,3,You can track SLAs in the application and in the reporting environment. All contract deliverables can be dated within the application and you can see which deliverbles are coming up on being due and which have been passed. Attachments can be added for additional SLAs and you can report across SLAs using the data that is retrievable in the reporting environment,3
69,839,2019,3,1,4,When invoicing for milestones it is up to the user how much of the milestone they want to pay. If the milestone is completed in full then the full amount can be paid. If the client feels the work was not complete or that a penalty has been applied part of an invoice can be generated. If the milestone is complete and a bonus is being applied the client can configure where an invoice can be paid out over the budgeted amount for that line item. ,2
69,840,2019,3,1,5,There is no difference in the functionality for onshore versus offshore workers. All the same features will be available to the client regardless of geography.,2
69,841,2019,3,1,1,Once a requisition is created an amendment can not be made to the payment and scope. ,2
69,841,2019,3,2,,,2
69,842,2019,3,1,4,Within VectorVMS there are approximiately 220 email notices that can be configured including a notice that will indicate when an engagement is coming to an end for a SOW engagement. This notice can be configured to go to any user group with access to the requisition/engagement.,3
69,843,2019,3,1,5,Headcount tracking is available for SOW resources. You have the ability to add and remove resources at any time from an SOW. Headcount can be reviewed in the system for SOW engagements as well as through the robust reporting environment. ,3
69,844,2019,3,1,5,"VectorVMS can easily integrate with any third party system to manage ongoing project management, SLA, and resource management. ",2
69,844,2019,3,2,,,2
69,845,2019,3,1,5,The name of the personnel of the SOW supplier can be tracked along with any other type of information desired by the client. This includes on boarding activities so that all of the clients contingent labor is held to the same standard in regards to compliance management. ,3
69,846,2019,3,1,5,"Utilizing our compliance manager the client can easily track onboarding and compliance for SOW resources. This solution is configurable for both the position type and the location as well as global requirements are available for all positions. These requirements are configurable by the clients and can be updated on a case by case bases if needed. This could definitely include and NDA. Other ways this is used is for background checks, drug screens, forklift license, driver's license, healthcare license, etc.",4
69,847,2019,3,1,4,There are over 4000 objects in the database that can be reported on using business intelligence. Using this information the program manager/ MSP can use our out of the box KPI reporting or develop their own report to track SLAs around the system. ,4
69,848,2019,3,1,4,Within VectorVMS we have pre-built reports that can indicate to you the quality of the supplier and the engaged resources on the SOW. All reports can be modified as well so that our clients have access to the data that is most important to them in regards to performance for contracted services SOW. ,4
69,849,2019,3,1,5,"Yes rate cards can be used for T&M rates. This can be tied to the rate cards for the temp staffing or new labor categories can be built out for SOW positions so that the rate card for temp staffing is differentiated from the rate card for SOW. Rate cards can be both position, location, and vendor specific so that when utilized across multiple SOW, SOW types, and suppliers the rates are more accurate. ",3
69,850,2019,3,1,5,There are two different ways invoicing for milestones can be handled in the application. The first is the vendor can electornically send in an invoice to the application for the client to approve and determine if they want to do a full or partial invoice. The client can also generate the invoice and do a full or partial payment.  ,3
69,851,2019,3,1,5,Our system has a full time keeping component for workers being paid on time and material. The client can determine to use timesheets to simply track time and pay approved time through an invoice or the client use the time keeping system as the system of record an use approved time in the system for invoicing purposes.,3
69,852,2019,3,1,4,The system has the ability to also track fees within the application to track known cost or a full expense module for workers to submit expenses that they have incurred while working on the project. Both of these have to be approved after they have been submitted for the transaction to be completed. ,3
69,853,2019,3,1,4,"Yes, you can create invoices on the fly or set to specific dates. These can be full or partial payments",3
69,854,2019,3,1,5,Our invoicing extract can aggregate time/deliverables across a single supplier or payee for consolidated billing and payment to the vendors. ,3
69,855,2019,3,1,4,When an invoice is being created regardless if it is being created by the client or the vendor the user will have the ability to upload attachments to the invoice that is being generated. The invoice can be integrated with supplier billing software if desired but the cost of building the integration would incurred by the supplier. ,2
69,856,2019,3,1,5,We have reconcilliation reports that can be delivered to the supplier at any time they just have to request a copy of the report through the system. ,4
69,857,2019,3,1,4,Vendors will be able to pull a report of all invoiced payments in the application and can communicate to the client via the application to let them know that there is a discrepency between the invoice and the payment. ,3
69,858,2019,3,1,4,Individual invoices are created at the line item level so that the user receives individual approval requests for the line items that have invoices generated against them as to reduce confusion to the user. ,3
69,859,2019,3,1,4,"When a supplier submits an invoice in the application the client will be notified in their inbox and on their dashboard that there is an invoice to approve within the application. The approve user will be able to review the conditions tied to the deliverable to determine if they have been met before approving the invoice and can approve, edit, or reject an invoice accordingly. ",2
69,860,2019,3,1,3,Today we can integrate with any third party tax software for up to date tax application onto the SOW payment types. Our go to product for integration today is Avalara/Avatax. ,3
69,861,2019,3,1,5,"Within the application you can associate as many projects, cost centers, GLs, or any other type of financial code to the SOW. This allows users to ensure that the spend associated with the SOW is being applied to the appropriate budget. ",3
69,862,2019,3,1,3,If a project is a capital project we recommend billing that against its own financial code to allow for better reporting. There is no additional approval workflow based on whether or not there is a different approval process but you can add an exception approver if needed.,2
69,863,2019,3,1,5,"All financial information is both provided within the application, through extracts out of the application, and through reporting in the reporting environment. There are multiple ways to track submitted, rejected, and approved amounts. If there is a discrepancy between what is in the system and what finance believes should be paid you can either edit a submitted item or make an amendment to adjust the item to reflect the actual payment. This allows for accururals for our users.",2
69,864,2019,3,1,5,"The system acts as a system of record so users types for both the client and the vendor will be able to see the status of the invoice. This will indicate if it is submitted, pending approval, approved, rejected, etc. This way the client and the vendor will always be aware of the status of the invoices. ",3
69,865,2019,3,1,5,"When an invoice is submitted into the application the MSP can be notified that a SOW invoice has been submitted so they have the ability to review the SOW before it is submitted. We also have extensive reporting around our SOW capability so that the MSP can run a report around anything related to invoices. (outstanding, pending approval, budget to actual, etc)",3
69,866,2019,3,1,5,Budget can be tracked in the application. As you build the SOW in the application it will generate a budget for the project. As time goes by you can track your budgets to actuals and set a percentage at which the system will send out a notification letting the users know where they stand in regard to budget. Users can also receive a daily report of all the projects they have that outlines the budget for that project and what percent of the budget has been utilized.,3
69,874,2019,3,1,5,The system has out of the bos reporting for all categories within the VMS including both temp staffing and SOW. Some reports can be used acorss both categories of labor while others are specific to each module and are labeled as such so that the user knows which report they need to run to get the data they desire. ,5

8,2227,2019,3,1,4,"Zycus offer ETL services to our customers. We leverage a patented, artificial intelligence-based, spend data classification engine named AutoClass, which can accurately classify even cryptic, misspelt or abbreviated line items in different languages and currencies. It uses free-text description fields like Invoice & PO Description along with Supplier Name, GL Codes, item description etc. to statistically choose the right taxonomy code for spend classification.  The AI algorithm in AutoClass uses the frequency of occurrence of keywords in the training set to establish a probability-based model for on-going classification. It employs a machine learning algorithm to assimilate the statistics it generates from the training set. AutoClass can classify cryptic, multi-lingual and disparate data accurately, consistently and granularly into any category structure of Customer’s choice. The strength of the AI algorithm lies in the ease with which it can be trained. It uses a ‘Learn by Examples’ approach for training, making the tool scalable in various languages and verticals. Samples of accurately classified customer historical spend data are used to train the tool to generate AutoClass Models for spend data classification.  
Zycus typically classifies all data into at-least 4 levels of classification for granularity. Users can drill down to the line-item level (PO/Invoice) for reporting. We can support as many taxonomy levels as are needed by a customer. We've usually seen a 4 level or 6 level taxonomy at most of our previous deployments.  The classification engine AutoClass can classify data to:   
Global Category schemas like - UNSPSC, eClass, NIGP, NATO, SIC, NAICS, etc.   
Customized category schemes like a client specific customized category tree.    
A hybrid mix of global category schemes and client defined category schemes.  
Additionally, Zycus also has the ability to add additional levels/nodes to the standard category trees so that the taxonomy is further aligned to a Customer's requirements.
Accuracy guarantee would be at 95-100% of the overall spend. Typically it give accuracy of upto 80% in first pass. We have seen it improve to 90-95 in one or two passes.",4
8,2228,2019,3,1,5,"Zycus refresh involves classification of the data feed received from the client by running it against the latest AutoClass model built for the project. Maintenance ensures the AutoClass model is fine-tuned and up to date to accommodate new data patterns and thereby help categorize the spend at the desired  accuracy level.
The usual Data Refresh turnaround time for a monthly data set is 5 business days from the time the data feed is correctly received by Zycus with all the required data elements. The first 2 data refreshes may take up to 10 business days as the AutoClass model stabilizes.
On a Quarterly basis, in addition to data refreshes, Zycus will also do a model maintenance cycle. Quarterly maintenance turnaround time is typically 10 business days post the refresh cycle. The first 2 data maintenance cycles may take up to 15 business days as the AutoClass model stabilizes.
Accuracy reports will be provided during the Maintenance Cycle.
If any major changes happen, we also conduct a new perception alignment meeting, modify the taxonomy, handle new file formats, and/or rebuild the AutoClass engine due to spend added through mergers and acquisitions. ",4

AutoClass’ spend data classification technology is a combination of ‘Artificial Intelligence’ (AI), ‘Business Constraint Engine’ (BCE) and ‘Vendor Booster Model’ (VBM).
The AI algorithm in AutoClass uses the frequency of occurrence of keywords in the training set to establish a probability-based model for on-going classification. It employs a machine learning algorithm to assimilate the statistics it generates from the training set. AutoClass can classify cryptic, multi-lingual and disparate data accurately, consistently and granularly into any category structure of Customer’s choice.

AutoClass has already been trained and successfully deployed for indirect as well as direct spend over 240 organizations across several verticals. Zycus can effectively use this “pre-built category intelligence” to jump-start and ensure a risk-free project with extremely fast project deployment.

Thus, Zycus' AutoClass engine which uses ""AI+BCE+VBM"" approach ensures:
 - Faster data classification, thus faster refreshes turnarounds (customers can upgrade their refresh cycle within a week. For e.g.: few months down the line if Customer wishes to upgrade from Quarterly refresh to Monthly refresh, this transition can happen in a week’s time).
 - Accuracy and consistency, which continuously improves as the engine sees more and more data

8,2408,2019,3,1,2,"Zycus provides a flexible contract management platform that supports variety of enterprise contracts. Zycus has experience in working with both Buy and Sell-side contracts. Other enterprise contracts like partner, interdepartmental etc. can be easily configured in the solution. Contracting party will vary in case of different type of contracting scenarios. iContract will allow to create and store multiple contract types and sub-types along with multiple attachments, amendments, SOW’s, etc. which can be linked to a contract. 

Some examples of the types of a contract that can be configured in the solution:
- Legal
- Procurement
- Sales
- Federal
- Financial, etc.

Each of these types can further have various sub-types of contracts within them with defined templates for each combination which can be used to create and store contracts in the repository. Templates and clauses can be configured according to the contract type. Terms & conditions and contract details added to the contract are configured according to the contract type. Zycus Contract Management solution not only allows creation of clauses in the clause library but adds more flexibility by allowing customers to use customer/contracting party specific templates for contract creation. This ensures that contract template for all type of enterprise contracts are supported in the solution.

Zycus solutions are extremely scalable providing for any number of metadata fields to be configured; the evidence of which comes from the fact that our suite of Procurement performance solutions are deployed across many organizations globally including many Fortune 500 companies. Zycus supports various types of metadata fields to be configured such as text fields, numeric, dates, dropdowns, attachments, single-choice, etc.  Intelligent Reporting and analysis can be done on any metadata information including user defined fields. All these metadata fields which are used to capture information while creating a contract are configured as per Customer's business requirement. Industry specific details are handled in the contract management solution. Zycus can handle any level of data field for contracts. To quote a few examples of meta-data fields the solution supports; Contract ID, Supplier name, Contract owner ,start & expiration/renewal dates and ability to store a file attachment , contract types, addendums (e.g., SOW against MSA) etc. 

Zycus iContract allows users to attach multiple attachments in different formats to a contract at various stages of contract creation lifecycle as well as in the contract repository. In our experience customers attach scope of work, NDA’s, IT security documents, specifications, pricing sheets etc. Various file types such as MS word, PDF, TIF, JPG, txt, xls, Email exchanges, etc. are easily uploaded as attachments linked to a contract. Understanding the significance of supporting documents in different businesses, solution enables certain documents to be made mandatory.  All contract documents and amendments are under umbrella for easy user access. 

Basic clause structure is well supported in clause library. A lot of time is saved by adding standard clauses like pricing, payment terms, deliverables, roles etc. in the clause library.  This can be added by the legal team in the organization. Along with the default clauses, clauses with alternate verbiages or descriptions can be captured in the form of ""Alternate"" and ""Fallback"" clauses for each clause in the clause library.  Amended clauses will be highlighted, which make it easy to identify and differentiate from the standard clauses. 

Templates are stored in a global template library and users can create multiple templates based on different contract types, categories, different regions, etc. Meta-data fields in templates can be configured as per the business requirement as they create a significant role in template suggestion during authoring. Organization’s contract administrator can efficiently tag contract templates with attributes on which users will search the template at the time of contract authoring. Users with access to create / modify templates can create new templates and modify the existing ones. Users may leverage the templates (as created) present in the template library for authoring any new contract.

One of Zycus’ more recent and exciting innovations, Merlin AI Studio is an Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Platform. It is a highly scalable platform built to design & deliver intelligent bots for Autonomous Procurement. 
Admin users can access the MegaBOT Studio where they can assemble custom MegaBOTs using RPA BOTLets, AI BOTLets and other building blocks; train AI BOTs for Machine Learning, test the bots to checks accuracy, before publishing to the BOT Store for general use. 
Power Users/Business users can then browse through the Store for various available bots, personalize them to their specific requirements, and test and launch to see immediate results. The custom bots can then be scheduled for future launch/recurrence.
