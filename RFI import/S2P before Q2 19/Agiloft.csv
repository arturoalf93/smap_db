Agiloft won a competitive RFP for San Mateo County, California, for a county-wide system providing contract management for departments with diverse requirements, including Health System, County Counsel, Human Resources, Parks, Public Works, Controller, Court, and many more.
Agiloft has performed complex implementations for University procurement and legal departments. A recent example is an implementation for a large medical University. In this case, multiple campuses and legal entities share a single system, with independent contract types, approval workflows, and document templates. Some users may view and access all contracts and contract documents for all entities, while others have restricted access. Some departments, such as the primary legal department, can approve for multiple entities, while others only approve for their own entity. The system needed to be HIPAA compliant and easy to use, and it included import of existing contracts that were stored in disparate systems and formats.
